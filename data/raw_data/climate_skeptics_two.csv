three influential climate alarmist academics at Oxford UK now paying £45 month premiums to have their bodies or heads frozen when they die,"I was spurred to look at [this](https://www.independent.co.uk/student/news/academics-at-oxford-university-pay-to-be-cryogenically-preserved-so-they-can-be-brought-back-to-life-in-the-future-8651133.html) because the small city of Oxford, in which the college is very influential, is a focal point for the whole '15-minute city' agenda, with roadblocks and such. Supposedly about climate.

I immediately checked to confirm my guess they are alarmists. 

>Bostrom, Armstrong, Sandberg are lead researchers at the FHI, a part of the prestigious Oxford Martin School where academics complete research into problems affecting the globe, such as a climate change.

The leader of the group is a 40-year-old Swede on *Foreign Policy* magazine’s list of '100 Global Thinkers'.  


>the group have set up life insurance policies costing up to £45 a month in premiums ... When they are considered terminally ill ... A machine will then be used to keep blood pumping whilst the body is cooled  ... If only the head is being frozen it will be detached from the body, ... before being placed in a vat of liquid nitrogen for storage at [a cryogenic preservation facility](https://i.imgur.com/6Sav5Mi.png)

IMO the following is especially strong evidence they are crazy

>Speaking to the Sunday Times, Sandberg said that life with just a head would be limited, but that he hoped by that point the process could involve downloading his personality and memories onto a computer.

imagine the year 2100, one of these guy's head on pyrex plate is jolted to life and  after a minute to recover its senses immediately asks, ""What happened with global warming?"" and the robot nurse replies in a robotic voice, ""Nothing.""",135y9ni,18,0.95,5,1683057050.0

At least 19000 volcanoes newly discovered.,"Quoted from the article;

""The U.S. submarine fleet’s biggest adversary lately hasn’t been Red October. In 2005, the nuclear-powered USS San Francisco collided with an underwater volcano, or seamount, at top speed, killing a crew member and injuring most aboard. It happened again in 2021 when the USS Connecticut struck a seamount in the South China Sea, damaging its sonar array.

With only one-quarter of the sea floor mapped with sonar, it is impossible to know how many seamounts exist. But radar satellites that measure ocean height can also find them, by looking for subtle signs of seawater mounding above a hidden seamount, tugged by its gravity. A 2011 census using the method found more than 24,000. High-resolution radar data have now added more than 19,000 new ones. The vast majority—more than 27,000—remain uncharted by sonar. “It’s just mind boggling,” says David Sandwell, a marine geophysicist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, who helped lead the work.""",133l398,14,0.94,23,1682848562.0

Global warming is real?,"I’m curious about the philosophy and thoughts about the climate change that is supposed to be a hoax. I understand that there are a very large crowd that is making a lot of money out of this “climate change”, but does that really make it untrue? There has always been smart people that is using trends and strong feelings to make money.

My question is why you don’t believe that: 
Less trees (because of deforestation) creates a gap to which the oxygen is supposed to be absorbed, and more CO2 emissions than ever creates a gap between the oxygen/CO2 levels here on earth. Then why shouldn’t the earth be in imbalance? Temperatures rising (a bit), more natural disasters and oceans that is also absorbing CO2 is not keeping up, so many parts of the ocean dies (I don’t know if this is related though).",131jkd6,2,0.52,165,1682662870.0

YT short Dr. Kaku and the cosmos,"[https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Uddd9jHyI4Q](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Uddd9jHyI4Q)

Dr Kaku explains new discoveries by the JWT call into question the entire theory about the origin of galaxy formation at the beginning of the Universe - all based on a few months observation.

If physisits in the field of cosmology are willing to get back to the drawing board on something as key and fundamental as galactic formation, then surely climate scientists should be willing to at least debate or [review papers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.00708.pdf) written and confirmed by calculations and observations, that co2 has no-to-little radiative power to heat the atmosphere, with the possibility of the creation or [fabrication of key data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eupxXDV4DHE), then alarmists could re-write their theories of global warming?

edit : after all the Science is Settled, right? maybe not for cosmology - but certainly co2!

one of the dark motivation of people is to obtain unearned moral virtue.” 

We have this appeal to the messianic urge of young people. here’s how; it is true that young people should find their place as a responsible member of the society. This is hard and take a lot of genuine moral effort. This would include making sacrifices and growing up. Not being impulsively hedonistic. Here’s the shortcut offered to young woke mind still developing.  It sends a message to forget all that difficult conscientious activity. To forget all this because it’s just part of that disgusting patriarchy/ capitalism. Instead, just put yourself as an ally of this green and woke movement. Tell yourself you’re saving the planet? I don’t think that any of these ideas being thrown around actually is saving the planet. It instantly supposedly elevate you to the highest morale stature. And young people have this need to feel accepted and part of a group. Before it was only in universities but now it’s starting in primary school.  So what is it about that pessimist world view. That the planet is going to die soon. That were approaching this apocalyptic disaster.  In the media you only see one side of this.

Does a 'clean-class identity' archetype make the Green movement irrational?,"important: the  following post is not about any claimed consequence of CO2. It is only a claim about the likely consequence of Green policies.  And why don't Greens  understand them.

This forum has considered a few possibilities. Mostly that  they are a cult  or a religion. Others have suggested Greens want revenge or domination. Add another candidate to the mix: 'clean-class identity'. The suggestion that an important archetype involving fear of poverty & status loss play a role.  [archetypes of dirt=poor and green=clean]

Because particulates really are soot, ""dirty fossil fuels' [[google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=dirty+fossil+fuels)] became a Green trope.  Which expanded irrationally. Two examples are: how  they habitually CGIed soot to photos of steam from nuclear power plants and how they refused to understand stack-scrubbers in coal plants. 

A recent 'Brownstone Institute' post called ""*Clean vs. Dirty: A Way to Understand Everything*"" remembered all that:

>Notice the way we talk about energy too: clean vs. dirty. Oil and gas, with their fumes and methods of processing, are contrary to the ethos of highly sanitized people. Electric cars make less noise so they are surely better ... Facts don’t matter. Only symbolism and *clean-class identity* carry the day. 

History & economics both say 'cheap energy allows prosperity'.  But  when Greens learn that (or when they learn how many coal plants non-Western countries are building) they disregard all of it. Not even rising electric bills & a dropping standard of living moves the West off the position that theirs is the only prosperous way of life. 

extra: the German Green FM just came back from China and has doubled-down. That party plans to not just cut off cheap energy but also some cheap imports. headline: ""Germany's Baerbock says [parts of China trip 'shocking'](https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-baerbock-says-parts-of-china-trip-shocking/a-65375303)"".",12wxqi4,1,0.6,1,1682299001.0

sources of CO2 and google stonewalling,"So had a little chat with my progressive true believer dad - and he couldnt believe when i told him humans are
responsible for a fraction of total co2 emissions.  What was crazy is how a google and even duckduckgo search turned up activist and government articles and images/graphs focusing either only on human caused co2, or actively combatting “denialism” - but i could not find a simple chart of what was released from oceans, forest fires (sure humans may have a part but not like we do with fuel and industrial activity), and decomposition etc.

for one, does anyone have a decent link laying out the sources?

and secondly isn’t it wild how hard that is to find these day through our our current ways of knowing (web searches) - really a hard wall of pages upon pages of pushback and beating around the bush when i am just looking for simple facts.",12wig5o,5,0.59,106,1682269728.0

A thought experiment,"So say we have 2 identical (almost) cups with some hot water inside. Say it’s 90c or w/e, doesn’t matter. 1 cup has ir transparent walls, the other has just regular walls. And say we only look at radiative cooling.

So depending on the e of water and wall material one cup could lose temp faster, since the water will be directly radiating heat away, and with the cup n2 waters’ ir radiation will be absorbed by the cup and effectively only the cup will be radiating heat away. Is this physically correct? Lol. 

So we could I guess compare this to the earth (the ground and the atmo). And so if the ground emits stronger than the air, if you make the air ir opaque, in theory the ground will cool slower since only the air will be radiating heat away. 

Obviously even doubling of co2 won’t do much (air is still pretty ir transparent, co2 is a trace gas, etc), but still I think this analogy kinda makes sense. What do you think? 

Someone who knows physics comment pls, does this make sense or not? I think the 2 cups example seems to be logically correct but maybe I’m missing something.",12ujutl,6,0.88,39,1682114111.0

Thank you all for opening my eyes.,"I didn't see it before but street a few chats with a few of you if made me realize how much the politicizing of the climate and our impact is really about controlling energy and the masses by bottlenecking and pricing of energy. 

I want to say I had a good idea before but I was more or less on the fence. Here though, going through arguments and discussions, it's pretty clear this subject has been politically polerized to the point of making it impossible to have a meaningful conversation. 

This place really helped me figure that out. One side wants the ability to control the maases through energy choke points and make sure people remain depended on technology that can't be repaired but instead replaced and fed difficult to individually collect resources.

The other wants individuals to thrive on their own and add surplus resources to others.

I will say, I do hope climate change is a hoax. But the political sides are definitely scientific progress vs ownership and control.",12tt70t,49,0.73,121,1682059906.0

presentation papers available at [https://tomn.substack.com/p/tom-shula-a-novel-perspective-on](https://tomn.substack.com/p/tom-shula-a-novel-perspective-on)

the main thrust is that the pirani vacuum gauge is a precise radiative-loss measurement device that measures the energy loss from a heating element to he atmosphere by conduction/convection and  radiation. The finding is that heat loss to convection and conduction is over 99% of all heat loss - thus refuting the idea that co2 has some radiative heating ability.",12sx943,4,0.7,6,1681994137.0

Climate change rhetoric,">Climate services focus on users with specific needs for climate information, but most people learn about climate science findings from media coverage... Also, some media outlets have recently adopted and promoted terms and phrases stronger than the more neutral ‘climate change’ and ‘global warming’, including ‘climate crisis’, ‘global heating’, and ‘climate emergency’ (Zeldin-O’Neill, 2019). Google searches on those terms, and on ‘climate action’, increased 20-fold in 2019, when large social movements such as School Strikes for Climate gained worldwide attention (Thackeray et al., 2020). We thus assess that specific characteristics of media coverage play a major role in climate understanding and perception (high confidence), including how IPCC assessments are received by the general public.

What Happened to the Vikings in Greenland?,"Usually, that Viking settlement in Greenland (which was seemingly abandoned due to cooling weather) is used for evidence that ""climate change"" can occur without greenhouse gasses, and that warm weather is better than cold weather.

But this article claims that Greenland was abandoned because the cooling weather caused a sea level rise. Yes, contrary to everything else the AGW cult has said for 30 years, they claim that cooling weather caused a sea level rise. And they claim this is a warning about the present day sea level rise. (Which is of course caused by humans because natural climate change magically stopped somewhere between 1850 and 1900 CE.)

Inconsistency of the religious Theory of Uniformity,"For more than a century, the religious Theory of Uniformity,  developed in Britain, has prevailed in scientific circles as the  ideological basis of the universe. One of its most famous proponents was  the [parishioner](https://web.archive.org/web/20101007064257/http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwin-and-the-church-article) at [St Mary’s Anglican Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mary%27s_Church,_Downe), [the Bachelor of Arts and Doctor of Laws Charles Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin).  A century and a half ago, the Theory of Uniformity was only one of the  theories, and academic circles were debating its validity and  considering alternative theories. This was particularly true in the  fields of geology and palaeontology, since fresh, well-preserved remains  of large extinct mammal species were still being discovered in many  parts of the world, such as the South American pampas. Today, a couple  of centuries later, the undecomposed carcasses of large extinct mammals  are found only in the thawing glaciers of [Siberia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyuba_(mammoth)) and [North America](https://yukon.ca/en/news/mummified-baby-woolly-mammoth-found-gold-miner-klondike). For example, many such cases are described by [Henry H. Howorth, M.P., F.S.A., M.R.A.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Hoyle_Howorth), in “[The Mammoth and the Flood. An Attempt to Confront the Theory of Uniformity with the Facts of Recent Geology](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.220742)“, in which [Howorth argues against Darwin and other proponents of uniformity](https://doi.org/10.1017/S001675680019034X).

By today, the notion of ‘Theory of Uniformity’ has fallen out of the  scientific mainstream, with the ideas of uniformity and immutability  themselves having extended well beyond geology and palaeontology  (becoming a [uniformitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniformitarianism)  methodology in these disciplines), permeating many academic disciplines  and defining general ideas about time and space in the historical and  prehistoric periods. The modern maps of history textbooks can be cited  as an example, defining a figurative perception of the past even from  the schoolbench. They show absolutely identical to modern coastal  borders of land and river channels, implying their invariability at  least for the last several millennia. Well, all objectively observable  evidence of major changes, according to the religious Theory of  Uniformity, is automatically thrown into the distant past, hundreds of  thousands and millions of years ago. Perhaps, as some supporters of [catastrophism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catastrophism) remark, the Theory of Uniformity is a [defensive reaction of mankind’s psyche to the relatively recent global cataclysms](https://www.velikovsky.info/mankind-in-amnesia/),  an attempt to push them out of the collective memory, to eliminate the  feeling of anxiety about their possible sudden repetition in the nearest  future.

Building on the foundation of Theory of Uniformity instilled by a [Prussian-style national compulsory education system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussian_education_system), Canadian oil magnate [Maurice Strong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Strong) has [developed the now globally promoted “climate change” ideology](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/paris-climate-change-conference/12035401/Farewell-to-the-man-who-invented-climate-change.html),  which aims to stop climate change despite the fact that variability is  the original defining parameter of the concept “climate” itself.  However, there is a wealth of past cartographic material depicting  different coastlines and river beds than there is today. For example, [many maps of the past show](https://sibved.livejournal.com/31341.html)  that only a few centuries ago, in historical times, the space between  the Caspian Sea and the Aral Sea, which is now land, was a single body  of water. As a rule, supporters of the religious Theory of Uniformity  explain this by the mistakes and imperfect knowledge of ancient  cartographers, excluding the possibility of significant variability of  landscapes in the historical period.

However, despite the total dominance of religious ideas of uniformity  in academia, modern technology allows independent researchers to  re-examine established postulates and visually demonstrate their  invalidity. Thanks to the Landsat and Google Earth Engine programmes,  anyone can now study how the surface of the Earth has changed over the  past forty years. Some rivers have changed constantly and actively over  time in ways that would be almost impossible to see by direct  observation but are clearly visible in animations made up of aerial  photographs. The [Ucayali River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ucayali_River) for example, a navigable tributary of the Amazon, changes its course at an impressive rate:

Heads up to sub members,"Just thought to let the regulars know that one of the local climate activists appears to be maliciously reporting innocent comments and posts to the Reddit admins in the hopes of getting a permanent suspension of the Redditor.  My account was permanently suspended until I could finally get it appealed and received this message from Reddit admins:

>Thanks for submitting an appeal to the Reddit admin team. We have reviewed your request and have lifted your suspension.
For future reference, you can find helpful information by reviewing Reddit's Content Policy.
-Reddit Admin Team
This is an automated message; responses will not be received by Reddit admins.

I have to think that as the continuing collapse of the climate change house of cards continues, they are getting more desperate and more irrational and will continue their attacks on rational, skeptical people like us.  

So be forewarned that if there is even a hint of a suggestion in a post or comment that could be construed by an oblivious AI bot to contravene Reddit's content policy, even if it's an obvious joke, pun or clever turn of phrase, you will likely be permanently suspended with no warning and no feedback as to why, should one of the local climate activists report it, which they will.  

Always include some indication that it's a joke like a smiley face, or something similar, as Reddit apparently defaults to it being serious no matter how ridiculous.  Even phrases such as ""a punch to the gut"" or ""a slap on the wrist"" will be reported by these activists and could get flagged by automation as ""threatening violence"" so be very careful what you say and make sure to indicate you aren't being literal or these climate activists will break Reddit's terms and maliciously report it.  

I've also had a few of those Reddit ""calls for help"" messages for suicide prevention sent to me maliciously, offering services I don't need which is a wholly immoral thing to do when the system is there to help people with that issue, potentially saving lives.  Clearly these climate activists have no ethics or morals and will do whatever they need to because they likely feel justified since they are single-handedly saving us all from the always imminent end-of-days scenario and believe the ends justify any means, no matter how unethical,  immoral or criminal.  The brainwashing really was *that* good it seems.",12mf4mt,37,0.68,84,1681509602.0

Does anyone know if the IPCC is still using the hockey stick or has that been abandoned now?,"I have been reading Andrew Montford's book on ""The hockey stick illusion"" and I think it makes some very good points.  The whole process of gauging global temperature over 200 years ago seems to be based on taking core samples from trees and then trying to relate that to temperature.  The one to come up with the hockey stick graph was Michael Mann and I have concerns about how he interacted with the scientific community (withholding data and methodology to reproduce his findings, etc) and also Nature journal which hardly seemed to show lack of political bias.

Attribution of the Present-Day total greenhouse effect,"This [paper](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2010JD014287) determines the relative absorption effect of the different components of the atmosphere and models the net effects of removing or increasing the level of a given component.

# Summary:

This paper isn't meant to be extremely precise but rather to describe the approximate effects and interactions of various atmospheric gasses on the global energy budget in response to the repetition of outdated or incorrect statistics.

This paper uses an estimation that the atmosphere absorbs a net value of approximately 155 W/m2 of long wave radiation from the ground, which becomes subject to adiabatic process of atmospheric gasses (lapse rate) rather than radiating directly into space. Because of these processes, the upper atmosphere radiates energy absorbed at a much lower rate than it is absorbed from the surface. This results in the temperature of the atmosphere rising until the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere reach a temperature sufficient to emit this 155 W/m2 into space, along with the amounts transferred by convection and evaporation which are also subject to to the lapse rate.

The Greenhouse Effect is defined here as the 33C degrees measured increase in the temperature of Earth's near-surface atmosphere over the expected black body temperature.

**Individual Direct Effects of Atmospheric Gasses (accounting for overlapping absorption:)**

* CO2 accounts for about 20% of the Long Wave Absorption
* Water Vapor \~50%
* Clouds \~25%
* All remaining contributors total \~5%

Water Vapor and Clouds aren't considered greenhouse gasses in the usual sense, despite their dominant effect, because they are themselves extremely reactive to the effects of other forcings.

For example, doubling CO2 ppm increases radiation absorption by 4W and and temperature by .7C but results in overall 20W and 2.7C increases, after changes in evaporation of water and cloud cover and are factored in.

Removing all greenhouse gasses (.04% of atmospheric gasses) results in a 35 degree drop in avg temperature from 15C to -20C after feedback is factored in.

The model also highlights the highly non-linear nature of absorption in the atmosphere, removing 339ppm of C02 reduces net absorption by 28W while adding 339ppm increases it by a mere 4W.",12fw29q,2,0.62,14,1680982505.0

a bit of philosophy: climate change alarmist's concepts of Time maybe partly what drives them,"I base this first on that they don't care about past alarmist predictions (which they would not if Time was not passing) and second that in older periods of History concepts of Time were different, and different in different ways. Below I tentatively suggest a grouping of climate alarmists.

But first,  what they have in common. They all seem to want to have climate never change (even though it always has). If it is a Timelessness they want to satisfy then if climate never changes, a 'permanant now' culture  would be much more possible. 

Now for what might be different 

- super-rich alarmists  are like ancient Athenians at that empire's height. All of the famous ones 2500 years ago or so  owned slaves and did not value labor, For them the 'Platonic Ideals' descended (as it were) from above - permanent and Timeless. today  Soros, Gates, and the other billionaire alarmists  also seem to not value labor and perhaps for them the atmospheric gases and the weather are what is above as heavenly C02 PPM Ideals. ... Additionally, if Time stops they can imagine themselves immortal.

-  the Green voters seem to want Timelessness - but for a different reason. They do [correctly] value labor, especially their own labor has value is essential to them [right on to that]. They clearly are not neo-Athenians - rather act more medieval ... All European medievals lived in a permanent now, seasons were what mattered to them (not calendar years). The paintings from the period had a sense of Phantom Time. For example they considered the Romans to just as well have happened a few years before. ... Similarly the Greens today feel slavery in the USA  just as well have been a few decades ago (and the civil rights of the 1960 to just as well have been a few years ago). They are oppressed just as they always have been. Their labor is dignified and immortal. .. however if climate changes that's a marker for time passing and life feels more meaningless.

Maybe this is wrong. Maybe I will think about it more",12dt8ya,4,0.83,35,1680805711.0

Climate Research: In a Nutshell,"From a PhD student:

Increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide is expected to increase global surface temperatures by one or more degrees Celsius in the upcoming decades. There are many potential effects on plant and animal life and human society. The current models can only be used for qualitative purposes. Anybody claiming to be making a precise connection between climate research and policy is potentially committing fraud.

We need to take a rational approach to comparing the environmental and economic tradeoffs of climate policy or we will likely create even more problems with current mitigation strategies, on top of the challenges already associated with long term global warming trends.

In particular I'm here enduring the land of Marxist activists (University of California) because my concern is to some extent the gradually unfolding challenges associated with increasing atmospheric carbon, but more so the pressing danger posed by political movements and their supposed ""climate mitigation"" strategies. In my estimate, the situation which might unfold later this decade would be analogous to what happened in 2020 - where some of the lockdown related measures were more damaging than the coronavirus itself.",12b2l5f,6,0.71,51,1680566068.0

Has drought really increased 29% in the last 20 years as claimed in UN report?,"We are getting used to headlines like this:  [World “at a crossroads” in drought management, up 29% in a generation and worsening, says UN | UNCCD](https://www.unccd.int/news-stories/press-releases/world-crossroads-drought-management-29-generation-and-worsening-says-un?fbclid=IwAR2zujMaAqPr-NPuO_NPjYqiEXc_ef_4R_czt11Gca5tyyzEGKSTwYesivc). Apparently, droughts have increased 29% in the last 20 years. This is an official UN statement, so they should have solid data to back it up. My curiosity led me to trace the basis for this claim, so I download the report where this apparently is one of the main takeaways: [https://www.unccd.int/.../Drought%20in%20Numbers%20...](https://www.unccd.int/sites/default/files/2022-06/Drought%20in%20Numbers%20%28English%29.pdf?fbclid=IwAR0VHdXWio7cwGUY0z8U89Rn4ig-FYXuYsUUy8glW4dhtosCtPTKsSj72PY).

It's a report called ""Human cost of disasters"": [https://www.preventionweb.net/files/74124\_humancostofdisasters20002019reportu.pdf?\_gl=1\*un7mds\*\_ga\*MzI5MDc1MjAxLjE2Njg0NjA3OTg.\*\_ga\_D8G5WXP6YM\*MTY2ODcwODg4Ny4yLjEuMTY2ODcwODkwMC4wLjAuMA](https://www.preventionweb.net/files/74124_humancostofdisasters20002019reportu.pdf?_gl=1*un7mds*_ga*MzI5MDc1MjAxLjE2Njg0NjA3OTg.*_ga_D8G5WXP6YM*MTY2ODcwODg4Ny4yLjEuMTY2ODcwODkwMC4wLjAuMA&fbclid=IwAR20Nt7BLCLgIcMVTgqGJ32ZgA4--hRoAWjzncROe3Hh8Eyo5Bo2pPnFLnw)..

Indeed, it shows that the number of droughts was 263 in 1980-1999 and 338 in 2000-2019. That's an increase of 29%. (It said nothing about the duration of droughts, though, as the UN report claimed). But I'm relentless when it comes to this stuff, so I had to find their source, which was easier. These are recorded in the so-called EM-DAT, a database for international disasters. I am a boring dude, not so much into juicy conspiracy theories. I didn't look into it much but I don't think these EM-DAT people have much of an agenda other than to record data for natural disasters.

So is it true then, that drought has increased 29% the last years? That sounds terrible. If it continues linearly, we have doubled worldwide droughts in only 70 years. The question is of course how we define droughts. The EM-DAT define ""disaster"" on their homepage (FAQ #3):  [Frequently asked questions | EM-DAT (emdat.be)](https://emdat.be/frequently-asked-questions). The criteria are:

* 10 or more people dead
* 100 or more people affected
* The declaration of a state of emergency
* A call for international assistance

So you have a drought when one or more of these criteria are fulfilled. The problem is that they all depend on the population. If a drought happens where nobody lives, nobody cares. None are affected and there is no call for assistance or declared emergency. From 1990 to 2010 (just to pick the middle year of these two periods that were compared) the global population grew from 5.32 billion to 6.99 billion. That is 31%, pretty close to 29%.

What does that mean? We have not necessarily had an increase in droughts, we have had an increase in the population that is affected by and have reported droughts. That is a very different thing from the portrayal of the alarmists.

This is either sloppy scholarship or intellectual dishonesty. Like I said, I am a boring guy who believe that most scientists are trying to be intellectually honest, although we all have our larger or smaller degree of bias. But it does not seem that there has been much careful analysis involved here, and there is a credibility problem when this misleading 29% is used as basis for all the loaded language in the UN report: ""World at a crossroads"", ""climate crisis"", ""urgently required planetary action"", etc. That does not help my skepticism.",12aefdn,35,0.81,28,1680512296.0

Little Ice Age,"According to scientists, it cooled about 2 degrees Celsius or 3.6 Degrees Farenheit during the Little Ice Age. (1400ish-1850 or 1870).

https://www.science.smith.edu/climatelit/the-effects-of-the-little-ice-age/

Scientists always claim that anthropogenic climate change began in 1850 or 1870, which rather conveniently is when the Little Ice Age ended. The typical claim is that the temperature has risen about 2 degrees Farenheit or one degree Celsius since 1850 or 1870.

But doesn’t that mean that we’re still about 1.6 Degrees Farenheit or 1 degree Celsius below the historic norm in temperatures? In fact, we’ve only made up for about half of the cooling that occurred in the Little Ice Age.",124umoa,8,0.75,64,1680021523.0

Fossil fuels are the only reason we have a modern quality of life. The only energy source that comes close to matching their economic value is nuclear, and it still has major transportation problems. Yet environmentalists destroyed nuclear progress in the 70s.

Now after endless government resources being wasted on solar and wind all so that it ruin our landscapes and produce a tiny fraction of the energy we need, environmentalists have decided to protest them too.

It would seem they want a medieval quality of life, except that even that level of technology ended up with the total deforestation of Europe, something environmentalists now protest in developing stations. (Environmentalists privilege...)

Time Is Running Out,"The austerity measures of SDG climate change 2030 agenda will make people mad. Only with the hysteria and anxiety of a climate - not crisis - but *emergency* can they get on the other side of this. It's one thing to panic that the world is ending in five years, it's another for 5+ years to pass and it's not really that hot outside. So we have to all be corralled into this 15 minute cities where we don't really have access to information about what's going on outside. There will be tons of manicured information, more information than we can process, but all confirming ""the emergency"". Reminds me of that Disney+ show about the clever kids.

The climate change agenda needs its open air prisons fast. They need to be able to blame food shortages on the emergency, and pass guilt on to the insufficiently zealous. Otherwise the agenda will fail.

So, this is what the climate emergency is all about. Risky game of chicken being played against the public.

This is what the alarmist scientists are missing. Their side isn't having a sober conversation. They have no basis to be taken seriously by people who are still interested in critical thought. Tragic.

As for the emergency, you'll see things like:

1. LSD microdosing billonaire tech hedgie orders one of his quants to build a climate model in Python to see ""what's really going on."" From their cultural and political disposition, they'll assume ""they're not telling us everything"" assuming things are actually worse than what's claimed.
2. Billionaire and quant get stoned, hammer out some code in Python incorporating obscure predictive models on strange things like desertification or disease outbreaks, all from kind of bad studies that don't necessarily pertain to climate change. NASA models will be used but amplified for ""conservative results.""
3. OMG! 90% of the Earth will be a desert by 2035.

Share at high-level tech and finance conferences (where everyone is microdosing).

_Dynamics_ of Earth Temperature,"Global earth temperature anormality dt was never a static, but always a _dynamic_ parameter, where the ""reasons"" for changes normally are not ""in sync"" with the results, ie. dt.

From analysis of the Holocene (about 10000 years of data) we ""measured"" some ""time lags"" TLs, ordered here along the size of their  influence on dt:

> Total sun intensity TSI variation (resulting from changes of the inclination of earth's axis and of earth orbit's non-circularity):

==> TL-TSI = 100 to 200 years

> All other influence factors AOIF (including atmospheric CO2, H2O, Dust etc):

==> TL-AOIF = 100 to 150 and 200 to 500 years


In this light, many or most of today's measures taken against Earth Warming may look rather questionable, especially if they make serious disadvantages for the people effected.

At this time, we work on separating the ""heavily discussed"" CO2 effects from the rest of the AOIFs. (Can someone offer reliable CO2 data for the Holocene?)

Big Oil Rockefeller money funded the UN and their acolyte Maurice Strong started the UN Environment program and IPCC.,"Climate alarmists have been hoodwinked by Big Oil; have fallen right into their trap.  It is classic regulatory capture and controlled opposition.  The climate scam directly enriches the Big Oil cartel by regulating the industry so that smaller competitors go out of business.  The small amount of skepticism that came out of some companies like Exxon was likely deliberately designed to be weak arguments, as they distracted from the very simple refutation of greenhouse effect theory.

Worried about global warming? Drink the water in East Palestine.,"See what it's like to have a real problem.

Worried about the water in East Palestine? Go to Miami Beach during summer.

It doesn't work in reverse, does it? Between global warming and the water in East Palestine, only one of these things is a real problem, and it's not global warming. Global warming is fake and everybody knows it. The left laughs at ""climate skeptics"", for believing that the left is dumb enough to actually believe in global warming. If it's obvious to you, it's obvious to them. The left isn't stupid. The left is cunning. Running hoaxes for the elite is all they do. The right is working class. The right makes money by making stuff. The left isn't like that. They're feeble. They get by exploiting people who makes stuff, taxing it, ""carbon taxing"" it, otherwise cheating them out of it, writing academic papers about why it's necessary, etc... They own you, as affectionate pets of the elite.

Here's how ""experts"" invented global warming:

Let's see, here's a list of chemicals that come out of a smoke stack: Mercury. No, can't do anything about that. Benzene. Again, no. Dioxin. I mean, we can't make money with Big Pharma unless we make people sick first. Fly ash. Are you crazy? That's our favorite. Let's add that one into every product we sell. Here we go. Carbon Dioxide. A harmless gas that trees breathe, and it's produced by all life, not just by industry like the others. That's the one we'll say is destroying the environment, and it will be their fault not ours.

The left hates the environment, because they hate you. They are ugly sick people who were dealt bad hands by the genetic lottery. They want revenge against cruel mother nature, and target number one is anyone who has what they can never have no matter how much money they steal: good health. They are out to tear you down and make you sick like they are because misery loves company. 

This is a whole giant group of people that does nothing but talk about the environment, yet they will never even acknowledge the people of East Palestine. They will never acknowledge pesticides. It's all just this fake weather hoax because it's not really about the environment. It's about destroying you and your family with toxic chemicals. They do not actually care about the weather. No one does. That's stupid. They just use it as an excuse, whether it's spraying toxic waste on glaciers to melt them when it's global cooling, or spraying that same toxic waste in the air to block the sun when it's global warming. You will own nothing and be happy. You will eat the GMO soy. You will put your child on puberty blockers, if you're not already infertile. Kill all humans.

The right does nothing but talk, and that makes them feel like they've accomplished something because they're owning the left and it feels cathartic. But the worst that's ever happened to the left is that they lost an election one time, and quickly put a stop to it with mail in voting, and that's the only bad thing that's ever happened to them. It delayed the war machine and printing presses by 4 years, but who cares? They just put it in overdrive now. Are you going to keep doing nothing when you own nothing? You will have nothing left to lose. The enemy is clearly defined. It's the natural versus the artificial. Start talking strategy with people. I don't know how to beat them, but I know you can't beat them by voting Republican. Read a book about it. You have to do something. If you're a woman or a homosexual, you should be doing Project Veritas style stings on scientists 24/7. If you're not, you need to be finding targets for them and putting them in a list. Bring trouble to people personally. Call the police if their car is parked an inch over the line. Record them. Record anyone doing anything. It doesn't even matter what they say. In the future, even terms like latinx and blaxxx will be illegal hate speech. Make a twitter account and post nothing but peer reviewed scientific studies that conclude causation from correlation or some other obvious fraud. Make a public list of the scientists who do them. Call their underlings on the phone. See what you can find out. Look up the Sokal Hoax. It's a sorry state in science land. They've got unlimited money and no competition. It's not hard to find this stuff. It's everywhere. The whole thing is rotten from the ground up, and maybe if there's some momentum against it, we really will see ""the dam burst open"" like people here are always claiming. But nothing is going to happen because of some article on [WattsUpWithThat.com](https://WattsUpWithThat.com) that a bunch of denier people looked at. Nobody else did.",11zbwot,3,0.62,0,1679554603.0

Nuclear power,"So, I am brand new here in this sub. Trying to get a feel. What is your response to this tentative statement:
The earth does seem to be going through a warming phase. Humans probably have amplified that just a little bit. Americans (and all good guys)  should be moving toward nuclear. But that takes time so the first goal is to be energy independent energy exporters and finish the keystone pipeline. The first goal could be met within 2-5 years if policymakers cooperate. We extract energy in a more environmentally friendly manner, plus that wsy America gets the profits instead of Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. (Don’t forget the Saudis recently stabbed us in the back by pretending they wanted to normalize relations with Israel and then suddenly they normalized with Iran in a deal brokered by China). 


Second goal is to transition our electricity generation to nuclear fission. Because the whole process of energy generation over the life time of a plant (up to 70-80 years) is cheaper, safer, and produces less air pollution than fossil fuels. We will still use fossil fuel for transportation for the foreseeable future.  This is a goal that could be achieved in 20 years with the right conditions in DC, but conditions in DC will vary, so say 40 years to achieve that goal.

My third and final goal is to convert electricity generation to fusion.  That’s a 100 year goal.

Her first appearance was on August 20, 2018, with a sit-in protest in front of the Swedish Parliament, followed four days later by the release of a book she co-authored with her mother. A man called Ingmar Rentzhog happened to walk by the Swedish Parliament on August 20 and encountered Greta during her sit-in protest. Apparently owning a time machine, because the PR for her was already in full swing on August 20 and he financed and drove the campaign through his company called ""We don't have time"". Rentzhog is also the chairman of the think tank ""Global Challenge"" which is fully financed by a billionaire named Kristine Person, a member of the Swedish Social Democratic Workers' Party and former minister in the government under Stefan Löfven.

Based on a foto however, Rentzhog and Gretas mother had already met before at a climate conference on May 4, 2018, which is also the date Rentzhog became CEO of the aforementioned think tank.

Both Kristine Person and Stefan Löfven happen to be members of the WEF.

Troposphere does not cool through radiation,"If near surface air masses cooled through radiation, then the energy balance for the Earth would be far too unstable. How would you design a system that didn't overheat or overcool based on radiation balance?

Instead, the structure of atmospheric cells and the angular momentum of air within them creates a stable equilibrium.

As surface air is irradiated by solar energy, that energy goes into work against friction and entropy to keep the cell in motion. The heat is then transferred by advection to the tropopause.

Air doesn't conduct meaningfully, but figurately air masses do. Thermo-pressure gradients and lateral, kinetic transfers of energy among air particles maintain common temperatures within the air mass. However, after advection, the upper limit of the air mass is exposed to substantially lower pressures on top, while on bottom the air masses below serve as a floor. Some air will therefore continue to travel with the cell, but other air molecules will escape the pressure gradient's equilibrium. Also, sufficiently cool air particles will come into the pressure gradient and join it.

More heat on the surface will lead to more work against gravity, which will allow for more exchange of energy with the upper atmosphere, kinetically. The heat sink is too large.

It's also apparent that a lot of energy is transferred to other cells, and transported to extreme latitudes. Whatever balance of energy goes up or N/S is a matter of observation and good modeling, but in principle solar radiation will transport advectively and kinetically.

Obviously the oceans are involved and it can become quite complicated.

Once that energy is in the upper atmosphere, there is less ability to do work, and so over time it will radiate back into space.

Greenhouse effect hypothesis is absurd for 2 reasons:

1) Radiation doesn't work in a way where colder entities transfer energy to warmer entities. If the premise is exceptionally hot particles above (exceptional for this or that reason) warming nevertheless still quite cold and high particles below. The problem is this structure is a bit dubious, but more importantly it's unclear how it would ultimately have any meaningful bearing on surface temperatures as this is outside of the advection process.

2) Circling back, if radiation balance did play a factor in warming, then the Earth couldn't possibly maintain equilibrium over the long run.

As for oceans, this appears to have to do with the geological configuration of continents and depth of seas, combine with solar irradiance levels. This formula drives the energy balance of the atmospheric cells, whether there is ice or not at high latitudes, etc.

I just don't see where ""greenhouse gas"" fits in. It doesn't really seem like H2O can properly be thought of as a genuine ""greenhouse"" gas. It's more of a highly efficient energy retention and transfer system. H2O is moreso preventing a cascade of cooling than contributing to warming.",11xm4mc,5,0.78,2,1679416273.0

Does Hot Air Do Work Against Gravity,"Just want this one little question to get its own attention. The blatant disingenuity by alarmist apologists in the comments is really getting on my nerves.

I'll use an analogy they used: when you lift an apple, then let go, it falls back down so gravity is conservative therefore hot air can't do work against gravity.

Simultaneously they also argue that atmospheric convection cells are closed loops, so any motion against gravity is matched by downward moving air mass, and therefore no work is done against gravity.

First of all, you have to expend calories to lift an apple. Those calories don't go back into your body after the apple hits the ground again. I am honestly aghast that this is the sort of argument apologists are going for. The culprit obviously lacks the level of skilled rhetorical duplicity held by ClimateTalk.

Second, convection cells are not closed loops. They exist within gravity and are unbounded at the top. While some energy will be conserved in the convection cycle, there are many ways in which a convection cycle can take on or lose energy. Speed of rotation against friction. Height of the cell at the top. Etc.

Obviously, hot air does do work against gravity, and obviously a great amount of solar energy absorbed by the atmosphere will be expended in the motion of convection. What amount also radiates into space and the balance thereof is an interesting question, but to argue that all of the energy is expended radiatively is absurd.

> Applying this model to ""now"" gives 
a prediction of ""natural"" EW up to 2100.
> Besides, the difference between ""natural"" and ""measured"" EW gives an estimate for ""men-made"" EW.

The work needs some refinement:
> Better = more reliable EW data for the Holocene to get a more reliable EW model.

Apollo astronauts climate realists," **07.17.2019**

### We posted the entire letter and list of signatories at CFACT.org.  Here’s a sample: We believe the claims by NASA and GISS, that man-made carbon dioxide is having a catastrophic impact on global climate change are not substantiated, especially when considering thousands of years of empirical data. With hundreds of well-known climate scientists and tens of thousands of other scientists publicly declaring their disbelief in the catastrophic forecasts, coming particularly from the GISS leadership, it is clear that the science is NOT settled.  The names of those who signed the letter, or have otherwise spoken in favor of climate realism, are stunning.  They are larger than life. In America, if it doesn’t make the movies, or TV, it didn’t happen.  Hollywood has immortalized these scientific titans time and again, yet the media won’t report where they stand on climate. Consider commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the moon landing by binge-watching HBO’s excellent series [From the Earth to the Moon](https://play.hbogo.com/series/urn:hbo:series:GXNRHzQ2l5p63mgEAAAJ1), which has just been digitally remastered.  Tom Hanks does a splendid job both narrating, and producing this important historical take.  He did similar great work with Band of Brothers and The Pacific. While watching HBO’s and other great films about America’s exploration of space, keep your eyes open for some of the world’s most carefully selected, vetted, and respected scientific experts, who also number among the world’s most respected climate skeptics. On Friday, you’ll see Buzz Aldrin celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of his historic moon landing.  He’s what he told [The Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2814701/I-sceptical-humans-causing-global-warming-says-Buzz-Aldrin-thinks-people-sent-DIE-Mars.html) not long ago: I think the climate has been changing for billions of years. If it’s warming now, it may cool off later. I’m not in favor of just taking short-term isolated situations and depleting our resources to keep our climate just the way it is today. I’m not necessarily of the school that we are causing it all, I think the world is causing it. Among the many slurs the global warming Left likes to hurl at those of us who correct their dogma is “Flat Earthers.”  Would they try that one on Buzz Aldrin, Walt Cunningham, Jack Schmitt, Charlie Duke, Al Worden and the rest?  They’ve seen the curvature of the Earth from a unique perspective. Walt Cunningham was a member of the courageous Apollo VII crew.  They were the first to launch into the space after the loss of Apollo One to fire and tragedy.  [Walt has worked closely with CFACT](https://www.cfact.org/?s=Cunningham), accompanying us to UN Summits in Poland, and Peru and speaking on college campuses.  In Peru he jumped off a mountain on a hang glider (he was born in 1932) to highlight his conviction that climate science is anything but settled.  You should have seen the faces of the Obama team manning the NASA display at a UN climate conference when Colonel Cunningham walked in and challenged them point blank. Jack Schmitt is the preeminent scientist to walk on the Moon. Here’s what he said at a recent project Apollo commemoration: I’m a geologist. I know the Earth is not nearly as fragile as we tend to think it is. It has gone through climate change, it is going through climate change at the present time…  Right now, in my profession, there is no evidence. There are models. But models of very, very complex natural systems are often wrong. The observations that we make as geologists, and observational climatologists, do not show any evidence that human beings are causing this. When America’s Apollo astronauts speak out, attention must be paid.

###[We Have Five Years To Save Ourselves From Climate Change, Harvard Scientist Says](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffmcmahon/2018/01/15/carbon-pollution-has-shoved-the-climate-backward-at-least-12-million-years-harvard-scientist-says/)

###January 15, 2018

The level of carbon now in the atmosphere hasn’t been seen in 12 million years, a Harvard scientist said in Chicago Thursday, and this pollution is rapidly pushing the climate back to its state in the Eocene Epoch, more than 33 million years ago, when there was no ice on either pole.

James Anderson, a Harvard University professor of atmospheric chemistry best known for establishing that chlorofluorocarbons were damaging the Ozone Layer, said:

>We have exquisite information about what that state is, because we have a paleo record going back millions of years, when the earth had no ice at either pole. There was almost no temperature difference between the equator and the pole.

>The ocean was running almost 10ºC warmer all the way to the bottom than it is today, and the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere would have meant that storm systems would be violent in the extreme, because water vapor, which is an exponential function of water temperature, is the gasoline that fuels the frequency and intensity of storm systems.

People have the misapprehension that we can recover from this state just by reducing carbon emissions, Anderson said in an appearance at the University of Chicago. Recovery is all but impossible, he argued, without a World War II-style transformation of industry—an acceleration of the effort to halt carbon pollution and remove it from the atmosphere, and a new effort to reflect sunlight away from the earth’s poles.

###This has to be done, Anderson added, within the next five years.

>The chance that there will be any permanent ice left in the Arctic after 2022 is essentially zero, with 75 to 80 percent of permanent ice having melted already in the last 35 years.

>Can we lose 75-80 percent of permanent ice and recover? The answer is no.

The answer is no in part because of what scientists call feedbacks, some of the ways the earth responds to warming. Among those feedbacks is the release of methane currently trapped in permafrost and under the sea, which will exacerbate warming. Another is the pending collapse of the Greenland ice sheet, which Anderson said will raise sea level by 7 meters (about 23 feet).

"I believe I have discovered published misinformation by the NSIDC promoted by the NOAA, Is anyone able to verify this ?","Here is part of my email to the representative @ NOAA.

So with reference to Mika's 2022 paper and using the second law of thermodynamics if the Arctic sea has risen in temperature 4-fold since 1979 where is the melt trend using the sea ice maximum extent as seen above linked below along with the minimum extents and if Mika was correct in his peer reviewed paper why has the maximum sea ice extent noticeably increased since 2018 over the preceding years which showed a very slow downward trend and have not shown a progressive decrease in maximum Arctic ice extent in line with Mika's findings since 2010 as seen above and below using your reference source data?

As I have shown above there is no recognisable warming trend with the minimum figures that would correlate with the findings that Mika showed in his paper of the Arctic sea's increasing in temperature because using logic would that not defy the second law of thermodynamics ?

Also can you see why this 2022 statement from NSIDC seems to be a little misleading ?

The September 2022 average Arctic sea ice extent was 4.87 million square kilometers (1.88 million square miles), tying with 2010 for eleventh lowest in the satellite record (Figure 1a). Extent was 1.54 million square kilometers (595,000 square miles) below the 1981 to 2010 average and 1.30 million square kilometers (502,000 square miles) above the record minimum set in 2012. The annual minimum extent was reached on September 18 and the autumn freeze-up is now well underway. [https://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/2022/10/](https://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/2022/10/)

Because according to your reliable sources own website and data linked above, 2010 was at 4.90 million square kilometers and 2017 was in fact the one year tying with 2022 @ 4.87 million square kilometers and using NSIDC data the ""record minimum"" set in 2012 of 5.18 million square kilometers was not the lowest for that decade, 2020 was with 3.92 million square kilometers and all but 2013 were much lower in most cases than 2022 except the preceding and following year with 5.18 million square kilometers and 5.02 million square kilometers respectively and if 2022 was 1.3 million square kilometers above the 2012 figure of 5.18 million square kilometers would it not make 2022 6.17 million square kilometres according to your source's figures?",11n4c14,14,0.82,28,1678397187.0

"California rains, and does the Farmers Almanac use the 31 year Perigean new moon cycle?","- 31 years ago California [had an especially wet winter](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=1992+california+rain+snowpack). As it does this year.

- I admit 64 years is not double 31 years but biggest snowpack in California [since 1969](https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2023/03/01/snowfall-totals-california/11366374002/) - 64 winters ago

This is about 'the Farmers Almanac' seasonal climate predictions for the USA. There were/are two different mini-magazines called that. Both claim a significantly better than random accuracy. 

The mainstream runs one of them and I don't GAF about that one. Still a secret formula but so what?  They just changed their editor last year.  originally used sunspots, 

>*The Old Farmer's Almanac* was founded in 1792 by Robert B. Thomas, and initially made predictions according to sunspots. *Today*, it incorporates meteorology and climatology by using solar science and activity, weather patterns and more.

I would guess their secret is that they compare offshore ocean temps to prior years. Too analog for NOAA, who are a bit allergic  but not impressive to me. 

Now for the almanac this post is about, which [has](https://www.providencejournal.com/story/news/2021/10/15/farmers-almanac-predicts-winter-whopper-major-storms-snow-weather-new-england-mass-nh-vt-ri-ct/6091684001/) a more secret, secret formula, as it were. Claims a slightly better accuracy.

>*The Farmers' Almanac* ... was founded in 1818, uses sunspot activity, tidal action of the moon, the position of the planets and other factors. ... The only person who allegedly knows the exact formula of the *Farmers' Almanac* is its weather prognosticator who goes by the pseudonym Caleb Weatherbee.

I don't know but I think I can guess. I  bet in 1818 the new, second almanac was founded partially because they had managed to find New England records back to at least 1756 and had noticed a partial pattern of 31 years. now called the *Perigean New/Full Moon cycle*. 

Of course, the Almanac has always had to not say that was in the formula, basically because it never seemed to  make sense. in the last century or so the question would be, '*What does the angle of the moon as it crosses the oceans and, especially, where is the sun at the time have to do with Earth's weather?*' There is only a very fringe theory.

Climate Change for Dummies,"  

All of us are ignorant about most things. The universe is boundless, while our brains and our time on Earth are extremely limited.

That is why Socrates famously was quoted as asserting that he was “wise, as he knew that he knew nothing”.

Most men assume they are wise because they know things, while true wisdom is recognizing the limits of one’s understanding.

Of course, as beings who must live in the world and make decisions, we are required to make considered judgments about the way things are, so the wisdom of the active person is to act based upon evidence and beliefs based on that evidence, and then adapt to circumstances.

That’s a long way of saying that it drives me bananas when I have a conversation with people who are Absolutely Certain they know things about which they could not possibly be certain. Worse, it is infuriating to get lectured by people who have no idea at all about the subject they are passionately lecturing about.

Which brings us to, among other things, the climate change absolutists. As a scientist, I am perfectly willing to examine the evidence, listen to theories, explore what is known, what is deduced, what is supposed, and what we are only guessing at, and consider competing arguments. Yes, I am a medical doctor, but I also hold a bachelor of science in biochemistry, molecular biology, and genetics. I’m a scientist. I like data.

Despite that, although by no means am I what the fanatics would call a “denier.”, I am reflexively given that pejorative by people like adolescent Swedish demagogues and US Congressmen with associate’s degrees in communications with a minor in African art history.

Rather, I am a skeptic of what I have been told: of the data, (the volume and longevity of which are confounders) of the reliability of the models, (which exclude certain variables, like the sun, which are heavy influencers of climate), and also of the scale of whatever problems may arise from anthropomorphic activity. But I don’t scoff, because, as a scientist, I think the data is inadequate. I know that I don’t know enough to be certain of anything.

I keep “following the science”, as the phrase has been coined. But unlike the people who so commonly bandy about that phrase, I actually do follow science, which I understand. Its power AND its limitation. Eventually, our available science will get good enough to make decent predictions, I hope. We aren’t there yet, however.

One of the reasons I am quite frustrated by all the furor over climate is because of how droolingly ignorant almost everybody panicking about the the changes in Earth’s climate at geological timescales are. We keep hearing about temperature trends over decades, and occasionally centuries, but almost nobody talks about the actual timescale at which climate change takes place. We only have reliable climate “data”, such as it is, for the last few thousand years, of which there is only detailed data for the last hundred or so. And even that is extrapolated from a limited number of strategically placed monitoring devices worldwide, or non-scientifically recorded anecdotal analog data by scientists before there were such things as computers or fields of data analysis.

Everybody is freaking out about a degree or two in temperature, and very small increases in sea level.

It’s a joke, and there is a term for this in the realm of statistics: “statistically insignificant”

Sorry, it is. We have no idea what the significance is of changes in 10,000 year old ice core samples from Antarctica in a planet 4.6 billion years old. Is this aberrant? Part of a normal cycle? Related to solar activity? We have no idea, and scientists who claim they do are simply lying to you; presumably for either ego or political demagoguery purposes. Only a few thousand years ago the sea level was about 400 FEET lower than today, much of North America was buried under a mile or more of ice, and human beings were crossing land bridges to settle new continents.

We were at a glacial maximum not that many generations ago, according to existing data. As things warmed up things changed dramatically, and generally for the better if you are…well…….alive. It turns out that most living things don’t like things like being buried under glaciers. Who knew?

We are not talking about millions of years ago. This isn’t plate tectonics. Human beings watched the floods that opened up the English Channel and the connection of the Mediterranean to the Atlantic Ocean. Human beings walked to North America on a land bridge from Asia. The map of the Earth we see today has been vastly different within the lifespan of the human race.

Human eyes, in North America, saw glaciers that were miles high and temperatures that were wildly colder than today. So don’t whine about human extinction from a small increase in sea levels, melting ice, or a degree and a half of temperature increase. Stop the insanity and histrionics, please.

It is palpably absurd.

All this is to say that it’s increasingly annoying to have a conversation with somebody about Earth’s climate when they haven’t got a clue about the Earth’s climate history. It would be like a religion, if they believed in religion. It’s peculiar that the same people always seem to come down on the same side of both of those issues.

Now, the theory that increases in CO2 in the atmosphere would lead to increased global temperatures is based on physics and hence is hardly implausible. I don’t dispute the physics, although no model in today’s computers is sophisticated enough to actually make any predictions. The climate is ridiculously complex, and we simply don’t understand or even measure all the important variables.

But I am willing to listen. Eager to listen. Interested in the theories. But those theories are as well developed as our theories of what happens when two black holes collide–we have nice, very simple stories that get some of the broad strokes, but hardly a comprehensive understanding. This is why we keep hearing about new discoveries, and theories and invest billions in new space telescopes, but also why we should tread carefully in basing massive generational policies, the impact of which we have only begin to appreciate, on such limited understanding.

The belief that modest increases in atmospheric temperatures will lead to a global disaster and mass extinction is based upon voodoo and nothing more. We are currently in what is likely to be a short interglacial period (we are technically still in an Ice Age), and the current global temperature is still lower than it was in the last interglacial period. This is not new science.

Global temperatures today, in other words, are below average compared to most of the time life has existed on Earth. The Earth is not burning, but still shivering.

Unless there was a great mass extinction 140,000 years ago–and there wasn’t–the likelihood that reaching the same global temperatures as happened then or 340,000 years ago seems like not much to worry about. Last I checked, human beings walked the Earth 140,000 years ago, and our hominid ancestors did 340,000 years ago.

These are long time periods by human standards, but they are a blink of an eye in geologic terms, or in the history of life on Earth. The available data simply DOES NOT GO FAR ENOUGH BACK to make reliable models or predictions. Certainly not with the confidence interval upon which to base massive and devastating economic and societal upheaval by enacting shortsighted and overweening governmental public policies.

So how am I supposed to listen to and take seriously anybody who breaks down in tears fearing a degree or two in temperature increase? How seriously should I take policymakers that predict the end of life on earth in eight years when even the most die-hard cynical apocalyptic climate model makes no such prediction, not even close, in the next hundred years? These people, frankly, clearly have no idea of what they speak. Climate fanatics are insufferable; mostly because they talk so much and know so little.

I once, in the not too recent past, had a conversation with a very smart colleague who was leaving medicine to run a nonprofit that pushed for renewable energy. He lectured me for almost an hour about the melting of the Arctic and how it would raise sea levels. After listening politely, I pointed at the glass of water in which the ice had melted.

The level at which it was filled hadn’t changed. Because no water was added to the glass as the ice melted. Try it. Floating ice has the same mass as meltwater and adds nothing to sea levels as it melts. The melting of the Arctic sea ice is, literally, irrelevant to sea levels.

Obviously, if a glacier melts and flows from the land to the ocean that adds to the total volume, but this man lecturing me–who actually advised the legislature on energy policy and climate change–had no idea that the Arctic ice is floating and, frozen or liquid, would add nothing to sea levels. Y’know…..because physics.

Needless to say, our conversation ended there. Neither of us had changed the others’ mind, of course. But at least I temporarily humiliated him, and perhaps prompted him to think critically, so it was a good day.

We are lectured to worry about climate change and devastating losses in biodiversity. So I invite people to visit my state of Ohio, which was buried under a glacier not so long ago, and then visit the equatorial rain forests.

Then come back to me and explain how I should be concerned that Ohio’s biodiversity would decrease because of increased temperatures. I’ll wait.

Because…wait for it…..most biodiversity occurs where it is warmer. Which is easy to explain—everything about life is about energy, from the mitochondria and cell to complex ecosystems. Energy not spent on keeping yourself warm is energy you have to spend elsewhere: pursuing food, bolstering your immune system to fight disease, learning new skills, reproducing.

I freely admit that I am ignorant of what changes the environment will see with a degree or two of increased temperature, and also admit the possibility that human activity might contribute to such an increase.

And I will do so right after climate fanatics admit that reduced fossil fuel use would lead to the starvation and death of billions of human beings right here, right now. In addition to completely abstaining from fossil fuels or any product of them. Because without fossil fuels human beings would not only be infinitely poorer, but most of us would be dead. Frozen, starving, or dead of disease, or of any number of other horrors.

In short, anybody who ignorantly but confidently yells “the Science!!™” while knowing almost nothing about the actual science, studies, or models is not only insufferable, but childish. An Ohioan, living in a spot that was recently buried under a mile of ice, worrying about global warming is a dunce. I invite him or her to spend a year without gas or electricity.

That would last a day or two in our climate. There is a reason why the upper Midwest was still being settled after most of the continent was filling up.

Look at the population of Canada, please. It’s a huge country, yet everybody is clustered at the US border, and “everybody” is comparatively almost nobody because it is too cold to live there.

The population of the Northwest Territories in Canada–a HUGE chunk of land? 45,000 people.

You could dump much of Europe in it. And nobody lives there. Because it is too cold.

I am not opposed to being good stewards of the environment or seeking out renewable sources of energy. But neither am I interested in turning civilization on its head to do so, based on the thinnest veneer of so-called “science”, all the while denying that there are potentially hidden (or not so hidden) unintended consequences of doing so. Take electric cars. You know what there is several hundred pounds of in electric cars? Nickel. Ever been to a nickle mine, where they mine nickel sulfate? There’s nickel ore everywhere. Know what that becomes when it rains? Nickel sulfITE plus….. yes….you guessed it…….sulfuric acid. Go to a nickel mine. It looks like the surface of the moon.

But yeah, sure glad my Prius is saving the planet.

Bollocks,"Nothing new to report - just rehashing what I have learned from this subreddit, hopefully in such a way that everybody can understand it. Even those of us who are believers.

The work by [John Tyndall](https://theconversation.com/john-tyndall-the-forgotten-co-founder-of-climate-science-143499) and [Svante Arrhenius](https://www.bbvaopenmind.com/en/science/leading-figures/svante-arrhenius-the-man-who-foresaw-climate-change/) fitted the desired narrative: to blame harmless CO2 gas for global warming with the objective to redistribute wealth.

[Earlier I postulated that the main greenhouse gas, H2O, does not get the special status that is given to another greenhouse gas, CO2](https://www.reddit.com/r/climateskeptics/comments/105irpl/the_obvious_greenhouse_gas_theory_error_that/). Despite its low concentration of \~420 ppm, CO2 is treated as a mysterious wonder gas, that captures infrared radiation emitted by the Earth’s surface, after which it immediately releases that energy in all directions, with roughly 50% returning to the Earth’s surface. I argued that water is supposed to do the same thing, because it is also a greenhouse gas, but it does not. We all agree on that. If it did, it would never rain, and we all have seen rain. Instead, water vapor that absorbs infrared radiation warms up, expands and rises. When it meets sufficiently cold air, it releases its latent heat and condenses. Rain.

Why not? Because this is not how radiation works. Radiation is by far the least effective way to transfer heat. In most practical heat transfer calculations at room temperature and below, convection and conduction are considered while radiation is negligible. Radiation only becomes important when the temperature difference between two surfaces is very large, for instance when using an infrared heater. Those are red hot and typically a few hundred degrees in temperature. Put your cold hands in front of them, and there will be an exchange of energy, **with photons being emitted from the heater (warmer surface) and absorbed by your skin (colder surface)**.

Easy, not?

Now, let’s look at NASA/IPCC’s model. The infrared photons, being emitted by a relatively warm surface of the Earth, indeed are emitted partly in the absorption window of CO2. These will travel up to 20 m or so before being absorbed by a CO2 molecule **that immediately radiates this energy as molecular radiation (stretch/vibration) IN ALL DIRECTIONS so that it can heat up the Earth**.

No, it does not.

If you have paid attention, you also know why. Why?  Because that single CO2 molecule does not raise its temperature by a few hundred degrees when it absorbs a single photon. It will be a fraction of a degree. Temperatures in the atmosphere decrease with height at an average rate of 6,5°C (11,7 °F) per kilometer (9.8 degrees/km when the air is dry). Since air reduces in temperature with height, the CO2 molecule will *never have a temperature HIGHER than the temperature of the surface of the Earth*. There is no radiation originating from a colder medium that is being absorbed by a warmer medium. If we could make this happen, we could insulate something hot with CO2, and magically see its temperature rise until fusion would occur. There is not going to be any photon that returns to the Earth’s surface, the NASA/IPCC model is nonsense, there is no global warming caused by CO2, there is no greenhouse effect caused by CO2.

It is all bollocks.

Some will argue that the greenhouse effect does happen, but not near the Earth’s surface. It will happen at the top of the stratosphere towards the mesosphere, well above the troposphere, **where the temperature profile inverses**, with temperatures increasing with height (note that this is not the story that has been told to make people feel guilty). There is pretty much no water vapor at these heights. The few (thin air) ""hot"" green house gas molecules at a height of 40-50 km can radiate some of their molecular radiation downwards, towards molecules with a lower temperature. Those molecules may warm up a bit, perhaps resulting in a temperature increase, or just in expansion and convection.

Should we worry about that? Note that there is a vast universe above these layers (we did not discuss the thermosphere) with a temperature of just a few Kelvin. Since there is no water vapor, you can model this as a super desert (with an inversion of temperature), which will have no problem radiating its heat to outer space (if there was an increase in temperature due to CO2 - I highly doubt it). No need to worry.

Svante Arrhenius, John Tyndall - they should not have been put upon a pedestal like Greta Thunberg. Well, she should not have been either, but you get my point.

"Maybe Albedo, not C02, causes Climate Change","In another debate, I was told that the only thing that makes it possible for less thermal radiation to reach space than what leaves the surface is the presence of materials in the atmosphere which can absorb thermal radiation. He, of course, was referring to greenhouse gases. Respectfully, I disagree.

I have many concerns, or maybe I should call them questions for which I have not accepted the answers to date from climatologists. I understand what (some) climatologists are saying. I just find their explanations simplistic and naive, despite their efforts to justify their argument with energy balance equations. They systematically ignore the fact that the ideal gas law along with gravity means that the temperature at the surface of a planetary body with an atmosphere will always be higher than the calculated black body temperature for that same planetary body without an atmosphere (regardless of the atmosphere's components). 

Firstly, albedo is assumed to be a number that is treated as a constant, around 0.3. What if albedo has decreased due to, for example, pollution since some reference year? Then more radiation would be absorbed at the Earth's surface. The northern hemisphere would be most affected as it has the most sources of pollution. We've only been able to measure albedo since the 1950s with the advent of satellites. In that case, we are not wrong to go after dirty fuels, but wrong to accuse CO2.

With regard to albedo, I have yet another concern. Albedo is typically measured using optical frequencies. But most of the energy from the sun is in the ultra-violet. What is Earth's albedo in the ultra-violet? Albedo is a more complicated phenomenon than presented by climatologists. It also varies by angle of incidence of incoming radiation.

A second concern I have is the use of spectrum graphs that seem to show how the Earth is absorbing more energy than it receives. The assumption is that, since the Earth's average surface temperature is 288K, the Earth's blackbody temperature must be 288K. But we know the atmosphere, by itself, radiates. And, due to gravity and adiabatic compression, the temperature of the troposphere decreases with height. So, what is the average temperature of a column of atmosphere? It goes from an average of 288K at the surface, through 255K (blackbody temperature of the Earth without an atmosphere) to something like 223K at top of troposphere (depending where you measure). What if the effective blackbody temperature of the Earth as measured from space was actually less than 288K? Then the spectrum graphs might actually show an energy balance as expected.

Thirdly, I cannot accept the premise that CO2, a trace gas at 0.04% of the atmosphere, can force a significant change in temperature. It just makes no sense. There is simply not enough energy that could be absorbed by CO2 and then passed on to affect changes to temperature. 

Oh, then fourthly, the idea that there is such a thing as radiative forcing is ridiculous. If such a thing was possible, it would mean we have the means to raise temperatures above a heat source temperature simply by raising CO2 levels. 

I have other concerns with climatologists modeling that presume CO2 as the culprit The above are some of my top concerns.

So, what about global warming? I am more inclined to believe it might be changes in albedo than changes in CO2 levels. ",11fltx9,7,0.82,14,1677713297.0

Questions for faithful of radiative greenhouse theory:,"The atmosphere is loosely bound by gravity, yet some of the atmosphere is lost to space all the time. Parcels of the atmosphere heated by the sun immediately expand and rise due to lower density. This convection transports heat from surface closer to space, speeding the radiative loss to space. This convection is capable of increasing if solar input increases. There is no evidence of a cooler gas at higher elevation having the energy capacity to warm parcels below it, as the parcels below it already possess the higher energy state that the cooler gas would be trying to impart to it. Similar to how a molecule with an electron already in the excited state cannot absorb another photon that would put it in the excited state, a molecule vibrating or speeding at a certain rate cannot be made to vibrate faster nor speed faster by the same energy photon that got it there in the first place. So, how do you believe the warmer lower layers absorb energy they can’t absorb by their nature of already possessing that energy level?  Why do you only reference “experiments” in which co2 is heated by a hotter source?  And what is the mechanism for “slowing cooling” when the convection overwhelms the radiation in the lower troposphere, as warmed parcels expand upward?  As heat transfer is strictly a function of the temperature difference, “slowing cooling” could only theoretically raise the minimum temperature but could not increase max temperature, as max temperature is set by the heating source; the sun. 

Also, show your model that uses the true solar earth system, using true solar input rather than a non physical average that stupidly assumes the earth is flat and always facing the sun at twice the real distance from the sun, which is what a 240 w/m2 constant insolation assumption is. The true solar power is measured at over 1000w/m2 in the tropics on a clear day. This energy is almost completely absorbed by the oceans and redistributed by convection. 

Also, show the exact amount of solar energy you believe is “trapped” by the exact amount of human produced co2 that is still in the atmosphere and show your calculations and why you are so sure you know the temperature changes by some exact amount and have ruled out all natural sources of co2 and have proven that co2 actually “traps” heat.

Wouldn’t the middle of America become the American Sahara if the climate warmed up enough?,"The Dust Bowl of the 1930’s remains the benchmark for historic heatwaves in the United States. The central plains and Midwest experienced a major multi year drought that lasted almost the whole decade of the 1930’s and in several areas it was the warmest decade on modern record.

Several articles online state that winters across parts of the country were also mild compared to the last several decades in the United States.

I wonder what would happen 
If yearly mean temperatures exceed the average summer and winter temperatures in the 1930’s across much of 
The USA(due to natural climate variability)

Questions from someone who cares about the environment but has many issues with the climate change narrative,"Okay so in the interest of transparency I'm going to school for an environmental related degree. I care deeply about the environment and how humans can live with and not apart from the non-human created parts of our world.  Im having a lot of issues with many of the narratives pushed by environmentalists and those I'd consider to be green energy pushers. I've come to this sub-reddit to ask some questions because it seems to be a place where concerns and ideas about the climate change narrative are shared. 

Here are my questions:

Word association: Climate Change

 
 
 
Why did you pick that word/those words?

 
 
 
What is your understanding of the concept/topic of Climate Change?

 
 
 
Does Global Warming mean anything different to you than Climate Change?

 
 
 
What are your issues/concerns when people and politicians talk about climate change?

 
 
 
Earth historically has gone through hot and cold periods (on a geological time scale); we’re currently coming into a warm period.  Do you think humans are having an impact on this warming period?

 
 

If you think the earth is warming, what can we as humans do to slow/stop that process, or do we just let it rock and see what happens? Should we even do anything?

 
 

What is it about certain scientist that make you trust them over others on the topic of climate change? (Hard to know who to trust when a lot of research is funded by industries in fossil fuel/green energy looking for findings that help their bottom line)

 
 
 
Questions you’d like to ask me?

If the effects of climate change are mostly felt by the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in winter does that mean the only thing to be at all concerned about are rising sea levels?,"Elevated CO2 levels and temperature changes have both been occurring mostly in the Northern Hemisphere, and the impacts have been mostly felt in winter. The tropics have been much less affected. This is important because it means that:

a) The impact of rising CO2 levels will be negligible on Tropical Storms – as these are generated at sea the negligible rise in sea temperatures can not be affecting these.

b) the idea that some parts of hotter regions of the planet will become uninhabitable and that there are climate refugees due to these increased temperatures is reduced.

c) All other models which forecast increase extreme events in the tropics need to be looked at with a degree of scepticism.

For example, the average night temperature in winter Canada is about -15 Celsius. If this has risen from -18 Celsius is this a massive issue?",11bucem,0,0.5,17,1677355719.0
