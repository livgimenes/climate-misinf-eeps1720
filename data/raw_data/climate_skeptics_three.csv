The Lefty's On Reddit are Out of Control,"So, there's this post on /r/philosophy and someone mention the words ""climate change denier"", which is a phrase I take intellectual exception to. I posted the following, rational response and had it censored. 

""This phraseology ""climate change denier"", is not only inaccurate, it is insulting. Nobody seriously denies that the climate is warming and nobody calls themselves a ""climate change denier"". That is a label given to people who are skeptical of the claims of doom and gloom made by the eco-warriors.

What is a matter of debate is whether the change is man-made and whether it is something to be alarmed about. Despite what some would have you believe, science is never settled and there are legitimate scientific reasons to question the consensus that the climate's change is anthropogenic in nature and that a crisis is imminent if not already happening.

There was a time when Eugenics was the consensus best way to improve humanity. Science is not done by consensus and skepticism is a fundamental part of science.

Using the word denier is not only inaccurate for the reason mentioned before, it is insulting because it tries to attribute the same negative feelings associated with holocaust deniers.

""The world is literally a greener place than it was 20 years ago."" This according to NASA. Worldwide, poverty is at all time lows. America‚Äîa large, high-tech country that accounts for about 25% of the global economy‚Äîis now generally using less of most resources year after year, even as its economy and population continue to grow. What‚Äôs more, the US is polluting the air and water less, emitting fewer greenhouse gases, and replenishing endangered animal populations.

The bottom line is that the climate change hysteria is not a science-based movement. It is a political movement. Scientist don't call skeptics of their science ""Heretics"". That is more the language of a religion than it is of science.""

Watch as the climate agenda disappears from media,"This is something I've been thinking about for some time now. I've been increasingly worried about the world economy the last few years, and now it looks as the big crash is finally here. Markets are dropping, and this is quickly escalating beyond central banks control.

I live in Scandinavia where the climate hysteria is probably strongest, and already the climate agenda is losing ground. Our government put a task force together last year that had to form a plan for reduction of CO2 by 70% before 2030. I'm not kidding - people actually believed that this was in any way possible. 

Well yesterday the task force presented its plan, and within two hours it was completely taken apart by industrial entities and by the minister of climate himself. It was glaringly obvious to all that this reduction would completely destroy our country. The price would be astronomical, and the only result would of course be that jobs moved to other countries and therefore may reduce our CO2 emmission but increasing it in other countries too.

I think it'll be fun to watch as the climate agenda disappears over the next year. I'm willing to bet that by 2022 nobody will be talking about climate. Maybe Greta Thunberg will be selling burgers in the local McDonalds by then.",fgawu4,207,0.92,54,1583830965.0

"Man made warming is a hoax, period. But that‚Äôs not what we should expose. What we should expose is the fact that science in the XXI century is 100% driven by politics. Science is corrupted.","The age of independent truth seekers is long gone, that‚Äôs the real problem. Today‚Äôs ‚Äúscientists‚Äù are just debt slaves pitching specific political agendas for governments and corporations in exchange for their daily bread. Their job is not to find the truth, but to produce ‚Äúscientific evidence‚Äù that supports whatever narrative they are paid to support. Climate scientists are like parasites. They survive on the reputation of result driven, truth seeking scientists that created rockets, computers and modern medicine. They can‚Äôt produce any real advancement for the human kind. But they can produce what they are paid to produce: mass hysteria. Government dumps money on ‚Äúclimate change‚Äù narrative, mercenaries produce the evidence for the narrative. The more money in it, the more fake their science is. Right now it is 99% fake.",ckp04g,201,0.9,56,1564669255.0

I've been driven here due to the cult-like attitude of climate change activists,"Let me start by saying I believe in climate change, even believe that humans are having some effect; but when I question any little thing about it, then I'm immediately labeled a denier. I get irked by people saying every weather event these day's is due to climate change. For example the tropical system in the gulf right now. It isn't even a tropical storm and people are already going on about climate change and how this is the new norm. Meanwhile Hurricane season has been June 1st-Nov. 1st since forever. Same thing with the tornado's in May over the central plains. May has always historically been the most active tornado month yet a slightly above normal year is immediately labeled climate change. Completely ignoring the fact that 6 of the past 7 years were below normal. It is a big turn off to me that weather events that are fairly normal in terms of severity are always labeled climate change. The other thing that bothers me is the constant doom and gloom, worlds ending type shit. Again I totally believe we are influencing the planet's climate in some way, but I think it's ridiculous to think the entire system is going to collapse in x years. The earth has been though worse and somehow life carried on. If you even question that, you are labeled a denier. Are we at the point where even people that largely believe in human caused climate change are now deniers because they don't believe every single weather event is climate change and don't believe that the world is ending?",cbvwku,196,0.95,61,1562853147.0

""Cook et al. (2013) attempted to categorize 11,944 abstracts of papers (not even entire papers) to their level of endorsement of AGW and found 7930 (66%) held no position on AGW.

Their methodology was so fatally flawed that they falsely classified skeptic papers as endorsing AGW, apparently believing to know more about the papers than their authors. Cook et al.‚Äôs author self-ratings simply confirmed the worthlessness of their methodology, as they were not representative of the sample since only 4% of the authors (1189 of 29,083) rated their own papers and of these 63% disagreed with their abstract ratings.""

&#x200B;

**Imagine that there is a new scientific theory that warns of an impending crisis, and points to a way out.**

This theory quickly draws support from leading scientists, politicians and celebrities around the world. Research is funded by distinguished philanthropies, and carried out at prestigious universities. The crisis is reported frequently in the media. The science is taught in college and high school classrooms.

I don‚Äôt mean global warming. I‚Äôm talking about another theory, which rose to prominence a century ago.

Its supporters included Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, and Winston Churchill. It was approved by Supreme Court justices Oliver Wendell Holmes and Louis Brandeis, who ruled in its favor. The famous names who supported it included Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone; activist Margaret Sanger; botanist Luther Burbank; Leland Stanford, founder of Stanford University; the novelist H. G. Wells; the playwright George Bernard Shaw; and hundreds of others. Nobel Prize winners gave support. Research was backed by the Carnegie and Rockefeller Foundations. The Cold Springs Harbor Institute was built to carry out this research, but important work was also done at Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford and Johns Hopkins. Legislation to address the crisis was passed in states from New York to California.

These efforts had the support of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Medical Association, and the National Research Council. It was said that if Jesus were alive, he would have supported this effort.

All in all, the research, legislation and molding of public opinion surrounding the theory went on for almost half a century. Those who opposed the theory were shouted down and called reactionary, blind to reality, or just plain ignorant. But in hindsight, what is surprising is that so few people objected.

Today, we know that this famous theory that gained so much support was actually pseudoscience. The crisis it claimed was nonexistent. And the actions taken in the name of theory were morally and criminally wrong. Ultimately, they led to the deaths of millions of people.

**The theory was eugenics, and its history is so dreadful ‚Äî and, to those who were caught up in it, so embarrassing ‚Äî that it is now rarely discussed. But it is a story that should be well know to every citizen, so that its horrors are not repeated.**

The theory of eugenics postulated a crisis of the gene pool leading to the deterioration of the human race. The best human beings were not breeding as rapidly as the inferior ones ‚Äî the foreigners, immigrants, Jews, degenerates, the unfit, and the ‚Äúfeeble minded.‚Äù Francis Galton, a respected British scientist, first speculated about this area, but his ideas were taken far beyond anything he intended. They were adopted by science-minded Americans, as well as those who had no interest in science but who were worried about the immigration of inferior races early in the twentieth century ‚Äî ‚Äúdangerous human pests‚Äù who represented ‚Äúthe rising tide of imbeciles‚Äù and who were polluting the best of the human race.

The eugenicists and the immigrationists joined forces to put a stop to this. The plan was to identify individuals who were feeble-minded ‚Äî Jews were agreed to be largely feeble-minded, but so were many foreigners, as well as blacks ‚Äî and stop them from breeding by isolation in institutions or by sterilization.

As Margaret Sanger said, ‚ÄúFostering the good-for-nothing at the expense of the good is an extreme cruelty ‚Ä¶ there is not greater curse to posterity than that of bequeathing them an increasing population of imbeciles.‚Äù She spoke of the burden of caring for ‚Äúthis dead weight of human waste.‚Äù

Such views were widely shared. H.G. Wells spoke against ‚Äúill-trained swarms of inferior citizens.‚Äù Theodore Roosevelt said that ‚ÄúSociety has no business to permit degenerates to reproduce their kind.‚Äù Luther Burbank‚Äù ‚ÄúStop permitting criminals and weaklings to reproduce.‚Äù George Bernard Shaw said that only eugenics could save mankind.

There was overt racism in this movement, exemplified by texts such as ‚ÄúThe Rising Tide of Color Against White World Supremacy‚Äù by American author Lothrop Stoddard. But, at the time, racism was considered an unremarkable aspect of the effort to attain a marvelous goal ‚Äî the improvement of humankind in the future. It was this avant-garde notion that attracted the most liberal and progressive minds of a generation. California was one of twenty-nine American states to pass laws allowing sterilization, but it proved the most-forward-looking and enthusiastic ‚Äî more sterilizations were carried out in California than anywhere else in America.

Eugenics research was funded by the Carnegie Foundation, and later by the Rockefeller Foundation. The latter was so enthusiastic that even after the center of the eugenics effort moved to Germany, and involved the gassing of individuals from mental institutions, the Rockefeller Foundation continued to finance German researchers at a very high level. (The foundation was quiet about it, but they were still funding research in 1939, only months before the onset of World War II.)

Since the 1920s, American eugenicists had been jealous because the Germans had taken leadership of the movement away from them. The Germans were admirably progressive. They set up ordinary-looking houses where ‚Äúmental defectives‚Äù were brought and interviewed one at a time, before being led into a back room, which was, in fact, a gas chamber. There, they were gassed with carbon monoxide, and their bodies disposed of in a crematorium located on the property.

Eventually, this program was expanded into a vast network of concentration camps located near railroad lines, enabling the efficient transport and of killing of 'undesirables'.

After World War II, nobody was a eugenicist, and nobody had ever been a eugenicist. Biographers of the celebrated and the powerful did not dwell on the attractions of this philosophy to their subjects, and sometimes did not mention it at all. Eugenics ceased to be a subject for college classrooms, although some argue that its ideas continue to have currency in disguised form.

But in retrospect, three points stand out. First, despite the construction of Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory, despite the efforts of universities and the pleadings of lawyers, there was no scientific basis for eugenics. In fact, nobody at that time knew what a gene really was. The movement was able to proceed because it employed vague terms never rigorously defined. ‚ÄúFeeble-mindedness‚Äù could mean anything from poverty to illiteracy to epilepsy. Similarly, there was no clear definition of ‚Äúdegenerate‚Äù or ‚Äúunfit.‚Äù

Second, the eugenics movement was really a social program masquerading as a scientific one. What drove it was concern about immigration and racism and undesirable people moving into one‚Äôs neighborhood or country. Once again, vague terminology helped conceal what was really going on.

Third, and most distressing, the scientific establishment in both the United States and Germany did not mount any sustained protest. Quite the contrary. In Germany scientists quickly fell into line with the program. Modern German researchers have gone back to review Nazi documents from the 1930s. They expected to find directives telling scientists what research should be done. But none were necessary. In the words of Ute Deichman, ‚ÄúScientists, including those who were not members of the \[Nazi\] party, helped to get funding for their work through their modified behavior and direct cooperation with the state.‚Äù Deichman speaks of the ‚Äúactive role of scientists themselves in regard to Nazi race policy ‚Ä¶ where \[research\] was aimed at confirming the racial doctrine ‚Ä¶ no external pressure can be documented.‚Äù German scientists adjusted their research interests to the new policies. And those few who did not adjust disappeared.

A second example of politicized science is quite different in character, but it exemplifies the hazard of government ideology controlling the work of science, and of uncritical media promoting false concepts. Trofim Denisovich Lysenko was a self-promoting peasant who, it was said, ‚Äúsolved the problem of fertilizing the fields without fertilizers and minerals.‚Äù In 1928 he claimed to have invented a procedure called vernalization, by which seeds were moistened and chilled to enhance the later growth of crops.

Lysenko‚Äôs methods never faced a rigorous test, but his claim that his treated seeds passed on their characteristics to the next generation represented a revival of Lamarckian ideas at a time when the rest of the world was embracing Mendelian genetics. Josef Stalin was drawn to Lamarckian ideas, which implied a future unbounded by hereditary constraints; he also wanted improved agricultural production. Lysenko promised both, and became the darling of a Soviet media that was on the lookout for stories about clever peasants who had developed revolutionary procedures.

Lysenko was portrayed as a genius, and he milked his celebrity for all it was worth. He was especially skillful at denouncing this opponents. He used questionnaires from farmers to prove that vernalization increased crop yields, and thus avoided any direct tests. Carried on a wave of state-sponsored enthusiasm, his rise was rapid. By 1937, he was a member of the Supreme Soviet.

By then, Lysenko and his theories dominated Russian biology. The result was famines that killed millions, and purges that sent hundreds of dissenting Soviet scientists to the gulags or the firing squads. Lysenko was aggressive in attacking genetics, which was finally banned as ‚Äúbourgeois pseudoscience‚Äù in 1948. There was never any basis for Lysenko‚Äôs ideas, yet he controlled Soviet research for thirty years. Lysenkoism ended in the 1960s, but Russian biology still has not entirely recovered from that era.

Now we are engaged in a great new theory that once again has drawn the support of politicians, scientists, and celebrities around the world.

* Once again, the theory is promoted by major foundations.
* Once again, the research is carried out at prestigious universities.
* Once again, legislation is passed and social programs are urged in its name.
* Once again, critics are few and harshly dealt with.
* Once again, the measures being urged have little basis in fact or science.
* Once again, groups with other agendas are hiding behind a movement that appears high-minded.
* Once again, claims of moral superiority are used to justify extreme actions.
* Once again, the fact that some people are hurt is shrugged off because an abstract cause is said to be greater than any human consequences.
* Once again, vague terms like sustainability and generational justice ‚Äî terms that have no agreed definition ‚Äî are employed in the service of a new crisis.

I am not arguing that global warming is the same as eugenics. But the similarities are not superficial. And I do claim that open and frank discussion of the data, and of the issues, is being suppressed. Leading scientific journals have taken strong editorial positions of the side of global warming, which, I argue, they have no business doing. Under the circumstances, any scientist who has doubts understands clearly that they will be wise to mute their expression.

One proof of this suppression is the fact that so many of the outspoken critics of global warming are retired professors. These individuals are not longer seeking grants, and no longer have to face colleagues whose grant applications and career advancement may be jeopardized by their criticisms.

In science, the old men are usually wrong. But in politics, the old men are wise, counsel caution, and in the end are often right.

The past history of human belief is a cautionary tale. We have killed thousands of our fellow human beings because we believed they had signed a contract with the devil, and had become witches. We still kill more than a thousand people each year for witchcraft. In my view, there is only one hope for humankind to emerge from what Carl Sagan called ‚Äúthe demon-haunted world‚Äù of our past. That hope is science.

But as Alston Chase put it, ‚Äúwhen the search for truth is confused with political advocacy, the pursuit of knowledge is reduced to the quest for power.‚Äù

That is the danger we now face. And this is why the intermixing of science and politics is a bad combination, with a bad history. We must remember the history, and be certain that what we present to the world as knowledge is disinterested and honest.

"‚ÄúHottest May on Record‚Äù. No surprise at all this was a lie. Yet more dishonesty produced for ""The Party"".","Less than a week ago, a regular ‚Äúunfriendly‚Äù to this sub posted this article published by CNBC...

Earth has hottest May on record -    
[https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/05/climate-change-may-2020-is-hottest-month-on-record.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/05/climate-change-may-2020-is-hottest-month-on-record.html)  

This claim was then repeated by the BBC, BBC Radio 4 to be precise. The source of this claim was the Copernicus Climate Change Service of the EU, which, for anyone with a critical thinking mind, would immediately raise a red flag. 

**Unsurprisingly, this article exposes the claim as completely false ‚Äì**    
[https://notalotofpeopleknowthat.wordpress.com/2020/06/05/bbcs-fake-claim-about-hottest-may/](https://notalotofpeopleknowthat.wordpress.com/2020/06/05/bbcs-fake-claim-about-hottest-may/) 

From the article -    
I make no comment about the global numbers, but would simply point out that none of the official agencies have released their data for May. The BBC claim comes from Copernicus, the EU agency, not regarded as a reliable source. However, the BBC claim about the UK is hopelessly wide of the mark. According to the Met Office, last month was only the 15th warmest May since 1884, and was not even as warm as 1893 and 1911!

4. CO2 is not a pollutant. It is a plant food that is essential to all life on Earth. Photosynthesis is a blessing. More CO2 is beneficial for nature, greening the Earth: additional CO2 in the air has promoted growth in global plant biomass. It is also good for agriculture, increasing the yields of crops worldwide.  
5. Global warming has not increased natural disasters.  
6. Climate policy must respect scientific and economic realities.  
7. There is no climate emergency. Therefore, there is no cause for panic.

"Global warming alarmists always say ""We should just trust the mainstream scientists & experts"". Here's my response...","We shouldn't blindly trust anyone, especially if their career & economic incentives depend on pushing an agenda.

We should trust proof.

- Mainstream foreign policy experts & intelligence experts can be wrong about Iraqi WMDs.

- Mainstream economists can be wrong about the effects of free trade, or whether there would be a housing crash.

- Mainstream scientists can be wrong about global warming, or whether the Earth orbits the Sun (pre-Galileo).

Also, global warming alarmists kept saying that we should believe the ""97% consensus"" study, and that the debate was over.

It turns out that the ""97% consensus"" global warming study was done by a **CARTOONIST** named John Cook, and many of the scientists quoted refuted his claims.

[The Younger Dryas](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/abrupt-climate-change/The%20Younger%20Dryas) *he end of the Younger Dryas, about 11,500 years ago, was particularly abrupt. In Greenland, temperatures rose 10¬∞C (18¬∞F) in a decade*

There's two times it's changed faster in the last 12k years.

The increase in Co2 is will kill us.

Basic high school botany indicates just the opposite.  Even NASA has been forced to agree that the [earth is actually getting greener](https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2436/co2-is-making-earth-greenerfor-now/).  Of course they had to add the ever present ""For Now""  And then they add ""The beneficial impacts of carbon dioxide on plants may be limited,""  MAY BE, so they actually don't know and are expecting the worse. 

And just to show how wrong the doom and gloom crowd is.

Princeton professor and lead UN IPCC author Michael Oppenheimer said the following in 1990: By 1995,the greenhouse effect will desolating the heartlands of North America and Eurasia with horrific drought, causing crop failures and food riots. By 1996 the Platte River of Nebraska will be dry, while a continent-wide black blizzard of prairie topsoil will stop traffic on interstates, strip paint from houses and shut down computers. The situation will so bad that Mexican police will round up illegal American migrants surging into Mexico seeking work as field hands... WOW, can we say WRONG!!!!!

Within a few years winter snowfall will become a very rare and exciting even. Children just aren't going to know what snow is. Dr David Viner, Senior research scientist at the climatic research unit (CRU) of the University of East Anglia - Mar 20, 2000.... WRONG! The National Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center data showed U.S. snow cover on the morning of Dec. 1, 2015 is the highest on record for this day of the year. In all, 38.7 percent of the United States was covered in snow, surpassing the previous record ‚Äî 36.5 percent ‚Äî set in 2006. Worldwide, similar trends have been observed. Global Snow Lab data also shows Eurasian autumn snow cover has grown by 50 percent since records began in 1979.

Suddenly reality kicks in,"From a blogger called Adrian Matthiessen:

After our daughter of fifteen years of age was moved to tears by the speech of Greta Thunberg at the UN the other day, she became angry with our generation ‚Äúwho had been doing nothing for thirty years.‚Äù

So, we decided to help her prevent what the girl on TV announced of ‚Äúmassive eradication and the disappearance of entire ecosystems.‚Äù

We are now committed to give our daughter a future again, by doing our part to help cool the planet four degrees.

From now on she will go to school on a bicycle, because driving her by car costs fuel, and fuel puts emissions into the atmosphere. Of course it will be winter soon and then she will want to go by bus, but only as long as it is a diesel bus.

Somehow, that does not seem to be conducive to ‚Äòhelping the Climate‚Äô.

Of course, she is now asking for an electric bicycle, but we have shown her the devastation caused to the areas of the planet as a result of mining for the extraction of Lithium and other minerals used to make batteries for electric bicycles, so she will be pedaling, or walking. Which will not harm her, or the planet. We used to cycle and walk to school too.

Since the girl on TV demanded ‚Äúwe need to get rid of our dependency on fossil fuels‚Äù and our daughter agreed with her, we have disconnected the heat vent in her room. The temperature is now dropping to twelve degrees in the evening, and will drop below freezing in the winter, we have promised to buy her an extra sweater, hat, tights, gloves and a blanket.

For the same reason we have decided that from now on she only takes a cold shower. She will wash her clothes by hand, with a wooden washboard, because the washing machine is simply a power consumer and since the dryer uses natural gas, she will hang her clothes on the clothes line to dry.

Speaking of clothes, the ones that she currently has are all synthetic, so made from petroleum. Therefore on Monday, we will bring all her designer clothing to the secondhand shop.

We have found an eco store where the only clothing they sell is made from undyed and unbleached linen, wool and jute.

It shouldn‚Äôt matter that it looks good on her, or that she is going to be laughed at, dressing in colorless, bland clothes and without a wireless bra, but that is the price she has to pay for the benefit of The Climate.

Cotton is out of the question, as it comes from distant lands and pesticides are used for it. Very bad for the environment.

We just saw on her Instagram that she‚Äôs pretty angry with us. This was not our intention.

From now on, at 7 p.m. we will turn off the WiFi and we will only switch it on again the next day after dinner for two hours. In this way we will save on electricity, so she is not bothered by electro-stress and will be totally isolated from the outside world. This way, she can concentrate solely on her homework. At eleven o‚Äôclock in the evening we will pull the breaker to shut the power off to her room, so she knows that dark is really dark. That will save a lot of CO2.

She will no longer be participating in winter sports to ski lodges and resorts, nor will she be going on anymore vacations with us, because our vacation destinations are practically inaccessible by bicycle.

Since our daughter fully agrees with the girl on TV that the CO2 emissions and footprints of her great-grandparents are to blame for ‚Äòkilling our planet‚Äô, what all this simply means, is that she also has to live like her great-grandparents and they never had a holiday, a car or even a bicycle.

We haven‚Äôt talked about the carbon footprint of food yet.

Zero CO2 footprint means no meat, no fish and no poultry, but also no meat substitutes that are based on soy (after all, that grows in farmers fields, that use machinery to harvest the beans, trucks to transport to the processing plants, where more energy is used, then trucked to the packaging/canning plants, and trucked once again to the stores) and also no imported food, because that has a negative ecological effect. And absolutely no chocolate from Africa, no coffee from South America and no tea from Asia.

Only homegrown potatoes, vegetables and fruit that have been grown in local cold soil, because greenhouses run on boilers, piped in CO2 and artificial light. Apparently, these things are also bad for The Climate. We will teach her how to grow her own food.

Bread is still possible, but butter, milk, cheese and yogurt, cottage cheese and cream come from cows and they emit CO2. No more margarine and no oils will be used for the frying pan, because that fat is palm oil from plantations in Borneo where rain forests first grew.

No ice cream in the summer. No soft drinks and no energy drinks, as the bubbles are CO2. She wanted to lose some pounds, well, this will help her achieve that goal too.

We will also ban all plastic, because it comes from chemical factories. Everything made of steel and aluminum must also be removed. Have you ever seen the amount of energy a blast furnace consumes or an aluminum smelter? Uber bad for the climate!

We will replace her 9600 coil, memory foam pillow top mattress, with a jute bag filled with straw,with a horse hair pillow.

And finally, she will no longer be using makeup, soap, shampoo, cream, lotion, conditioner, toothpaste and medication. Her sanitary napkins will be replaced with pads made of linen, that she can wash by hand, with her wooden washboard, just like her female ancestors did before climate change made her angry at us for destroying her future.

In this way we will help her to do her part to prevent mass extinction, water levels rising and the disappearance of entire ecosystems.

If she truly believes she wants to walk the talk of the girl on TV, she will gladly accept and happily embrace her new way of life.",dk52v0,129,0.86,70,1571498264.0

With an explanatory quote:

&#x200B;

> According to the IPCC in AR5, the total solar forcing since pre-industrial times has been small, amounting to only 0.05¬†W/m¬≤. However, there are various paleo-climate reconstructions that show a large increase in TSI since pre-industrial times. Quote from¬†[**Egorova et al 2018**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00287.pdf): ‚ÄúThere is no consensus on the amplitude of historical solar forcing. The estimated magnitude of the total solar irradiance difference between Maunder minimum and present time ranges from 0.1¬†W/m¬≤¬†to 6¬†W/m¬≤¬†making uncertain the simulation of the past and future climate‚Äù. Quote from¬†[**Scafetta et al 2018**](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-018-4122-6): ‚ÄúThe solar radiative forcing is quite uncertain because from 1700 to 2000 the proposed historical total solar irradiance reconstructions vary greatly from a minimum of 0.5¬†W/m¬≤¬†to a maximum of about 6¬†W/m¬≤‚Äù. One of these reconstructions above¬†shows an increase in TSI of about 4 W/m¬≤ since 1800 which works out at a forcing of 0.7¬†W/m¬≤¬†(since TSI is traditionally converted into solar forcing by dividing by 4 to take into account the spherical geometry of Earth and multiplying by an albedo of 0.7). We can see from the graph above that TSI correlates very well with atmospheric water vapour. The solar forcing of 0.7¬†W/m¬≤¬†can be converted into a temperature increase with the climate sensitivity¬†[**feedback-equation**](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sN68ln2Rh58/XXj-hIeK76I/AAAAAAAAPyc/lvfm9iXEWmsw6d2cYbJJmHCsCBp5iHxrACEwYBhgL/s400/DESSLERFEEDBACKEQUATION.PNG). Where¬†ŒîT·∂†¬†is the feedback-inclusive temperature increase,¬†ŒîT·µ¢¬†is the initial forcing or perturbation, and g is the feedback parameter (a value of 0.6 for water vapour according to the¬†Dessler¬†2016 climate change textbook). This gives a total warming of about 0.42¬∞C which accounts for a¬†large¬†part¬†of the assumed warming since 1800 (a lot more than admitted by the IPCC).",d2qz7y,125,0.91,38,1568211926.0

Money has become the driver in physicist research. That money wants evidence of human caused catastrophe, whether the data backs it up or not. But don't date point out the conclusions don't match the data. The consequences are dire. 

Anyone who has the faintest doubt that this is so should force himself to read the ClimateGate documents, which lay it bare. (Montford‚Äôs book organizes the facts very well.)

I don‚Äôt believe that any real physicist, nay scientist, can read that stuff without revulsion. I would almost make that revulsion a definition of the word scientist.

So what has the APS, as an organization, done in the face of this challenge? It has accepted the corruption as the norm, and gone along with it.

For example:

1. About a year ago a few of us sent an e-mail on the subject to a fraction of the membership. APS ignored the issues, but the then President immediately launched a hostile investigation of where we got the e-mail addresses.

In its better days, APS used to encourage discussion of important issues, and indeed the Constitution cites that as its principal purpose. No more. Everything that has been done in the last year has been designed to silence debate

2. The appallingly tendentious APS statement on Climate Change was apparently written in a hurry by a few people over lunch, and is certainly not representative of the talents of APS members as I have long known them. So a few of us petitioned the Council to reconsider it. 

One of the outstanding marks of (in)distinction in the Statement was the poison word incontrovertible, which describes few items in physics, certainly not this one. In response APS appointed a secret committee that never met, never troubled to speak to any skeptics, yet endorsed the Statement in its entirety. 

(They did admit that the tone was a bit strong, but amazingly kept the poison word incontrovertible to describe the evidence, a position supported by no one.) 

In the end, the Council kept the original statement, word for word, but approved a far longer ‚Äúexplanatory‚Äù screed, admitting that there were uncertainties, but brushing them aside to give blanket approval to the original. 

The original Statement, which still stands as the APS position, also contains what I consider pompous and asinine advice to all world governments, as if the APS were master of the universe. It is not, and I am embarrassed that our leaders seem to think it is. 

This is not fun and games, these are serious matters involving vast fractions of our national substance, and the reputation of the Society as a scientific society is at stake.

3. In the interim the ClimateGate scandal broke into the news, and the machinations of the principal alarmists were revealed to the world. It was a fraud on a scale I have never seen, and I lack the words to describe its enormity. Effect on the APS position: none. None at all. This is not science; other forces are at work.

4. So a few of us tried to bring science into the act (that is, after all, the alleged and historic purpose of APS), and collected the necessary 200+ signatures to bring to the Council a proposal for a Topical Group on Climate Science, thinking that open discussion of the scientific issues, in the best tradition of physics, would be beneficial to all, and also a contribution to the nation. 

I might note that it was not easy to collect the signatures, since you denied us the use of the APS membership list. We conformed in every way with the requirements of the APS Constitution, and described in great detail what we had in mind‚Äîsimply to bring the subject into the open.

5. To our amazement, Constitution be damned, you declined to accept our petition, but instead used your own control of the mailing list to run a poll on the members‚Äô interest in a TG on Climate and the Environment.

Camille Paglia on Greta Thunberg,"**NM:** How do you interpret the Greta Thunberg phenomenon, or, to put it another way, what is Greta Thunberg's sexual persona?

**Camille Paglia:** This strange mummy that is Greta Thunberg is, as a sexual persona, a mad virgin similar to the Miss Havisham of Dickens' Great Hopes: abandoned in church by her fianc√©, Miss Havisham continues to wear her wedding dress in tatters , living with the remains of his rotten mounted piece in a decrepit mansion with stopped clocks. Thunberg also reminds me of these demonic dolls which appear in three episodes of The Twilight Zone, the series by Rod Serling: they are programmed by ventriloquists (Thunberg's parents), but very quickly they attack their owners and attack the 'human race. Greta Thunberg is the peddler of an apocalyptic propaganda from which she has been nourished by others and whom she is unable to support with facts. I have long been skeptical of climate change since it has in fact been a universal feature in the history of our planet since its formation. I am, however, a fervent environmentalist: we have a moral obligation to preserve and protect our natural resources, as well as to purify the air and waterways from industrial pollution. However, I reject these apocalyptic prophecies and current hysteria. The manipulative adults who, because of their own political interests, sought to panic the whole young generation, deserve to be condemned and expelled from civilized society.
