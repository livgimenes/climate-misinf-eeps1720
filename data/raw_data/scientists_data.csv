6qnd7y,climate_science,Abrupt Climate Change (and my ultimate weltschmertz),MaximinusDrax,https://www.reddit.com/r/climate_science/comments/6qnd7y/abrupt_climate_change_and_my_ultimate_weltschmertz/,"Hello Everyone.

My growing interest in studying climate science has led me across thoroughly bleak analyses and predictions towards our mutual future (e.g Guy Mcpherson's work). He's been described (in an article critical of his work) as a photo-negative of the climate-denier sphere, citing numerous feedback loops that may lead us away from linear energy budget growth models and towards exponential ones.

One example of such a feedback loop - As temperatures rise in the boreal forest, reduced permafrost coverage also reduces the refractive index of the ground, leading to higher heat absorption, which feeds back into reduced coverage.

Another topic I was made aware of is that of global dimming, which implies that reducing the amount of pollutants in our atmosphere would (at this point) lead to an increase in the total irradiance, tilting the energy budget further.

Setting those examples (of which there are many more) aside, I am as alarmed by these issues as I am appalled by the conclusions they draw - that modern human society can (and, according to Mcpherson, already has) lead to abrupt and irreversible changes in our climate patterns that would leave this planet uninhabitable (at the very least, for us). Up until that point, I was mostly aware of the linear, reversible trends our actions induce.

So, after all this morose rambling, I wanted to ask you fellow scientists:

* Can you point me to studies and projective models that take feedback mechanisms into account, set a lower/upper limit on their impact, and modify the trends accordingly? I was unable to do so myself.

* (optional) Provide any counterpoints which would offset the overwhelming pessimism I'm currently experiencing? Personally, I'm trying my best to adjust my lifestyle (stopped eating meat, driving, flying when possible) and affect other people's opinions (to extremely limited success) but at this point in my life (having just turned 30) I'm not even sure what future I should plan for (e.g should I be having kids?? I'm not really expecting an answer on that...)",14,10,1501493953.0

I mean on a social basis, and (not to be harsh but) I mostly mean with older crowds of people in communities and businesses alike. Spitting facts at someone is almost always not the socially aware solution. 

Comments like ""but don't they just want us to go back to the stone age and not use electricity"" or ""we should just go back to coal power, there's still plenty of coal in the ground to use"" are some thing I hear whenever CC is brought up amongst older collages, and despite how utterly stupid and wrong (no offense) those comments are. Saying that in a discussion obviously won't change their minds.

But what is? Those people often full heartedly believe what they're saying either because they don't know better or because you're basically arguing against what they've always known (I suppose in a similar way to arguing against ones religious beliefs).",2,1,1678714719.0

Climate change is junk science. 

The science of heat is governed by the laws of Thermodynamics. 

Heat is kinetic energy, the energy of motion - it does not get trapped by CO2 because it’s a gas. 

Yet this is the theory pushed by the climate change alarmists. 

To describe the impact of CO2 as being like a greenhouse is farcical. A greenhouse works by using a solid object to trap convection before the air cools and condenses. CO2 is not a solid object. 

CO2 absorbs and emits radiation. It does not trap convection. Furthermore it absorbs and emits incoming radiation at 2.8 microns while only absorbing outgoing radiation at 14.8 microns. 

Applying planks rule e = hv, the incoming radiation absorbed by CO2 is 5 times more powerful than the outgoing radiation absorbed. 

Regardless, as Einstein said in 1917, the amount of energy transferred by radiation is so small it always drops out. 

The most powerful form of heat transfer in the atmosphere is convection which is governed by the second law of thermodynamics. The entropy of a system must always increase. 

As such hot air will rise not fall. Outer space is negative 270 degrees Celsius. Our atmosphere is always losing heat because of this differential.

* Daily we emit 117 million tons of CO2. Global CO2 emissions are 43 billion tons each year. [\[S\]](https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-global-greenhouse-gas-emissions)
* As CO2 concentrations build in the atmosphere, infrared light radiated from earth's surface is absorbed by the CO2. Thus trapping heat in earth's atmosphere. This is known as the greenhouse effect. [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect)
* 38% of global CO2 emissions have dissolved in the oceans. When CO2 dissolves in water it forms carbonic acid. This is known as ocean acidification. [\[S\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781856176361000122?via%3Dihub) [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_storage_of_carbon_dioxide) [\[S\]](https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/pubs/outstand/feel2633/feel2633.shtml)
* The ocean has 50 times more CO2 than the atmosphere. The ocean has 39,000 billion tons of CO2. The atmosphere has 750 billion tons of CO2. [\[S\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781856176361000122?via%3Dihub)
* As the ocean becomes more acidic, less CO2 is able to be stored in the water. This leads to CO2 being released from the ocean and sent to the atmosphere. The same goes for ocean temperature. As water temperature rises, less CO2 is able to stay dissolved (e.g. leave a carbonated drink out on a warm day). [\[S\]](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016RG000533)
* As temperatures rise, soil begins to increase the release of carbon in a process known as soil respiration. Researchers estimate soil carbon loss over the 21st century will be equivalent to two decades of carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels. [\[S\]](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aan2874)

# Solutions:

* **Ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE):** Use mafic and ultramafic rocks (olivine, peridotite, etc.) to bind to CO2 and form carbonates. Thus converting CO2 into an alkaline carbonate mineral. These carbonates could then be placed in the ocean to raise the pH and bring it back to normal levels, and increase CO2 storage capacity in the ocean. [\[S\]](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c08561) [\[S\]](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fclim.2019.00007/full)
* **Direct air capture (DAC):** Use large fans to concentrate CO2 into a chamber and then absorb the CO2 by various means. The CO2 can be converted into a long term storage medium such as a carbonate or left as vapor CO2. In the case of vapor CO2 there is some commercial value or it can be pumped into geological wells for storage. [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_air_capture)
* **Renewable energy:** Wind, solar, geothermal, wave/tidal/marine power, etc. [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy)
* **Cultured meats:** Growing meat from cell cultures instead of factory farming. This would free up billions of acres globally, democratize access to protein sources, and eliminate CO2 and CH4 emissions associated with factory farming. In the United States 41% of land use goes towards grazing and animal feed crops. These areas of land are usually high in sunlight and could be used for solar, wind, afforestation, or DAC. [\[S\]](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-economy/land-use-land-value-tenure/major-land-uses/) [\[S\]](https://cellbasedtech.com/lab-grown-meat-companies) [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_agriculture)
* **Reducing fossil fuel emissions:** This can be done by scrubbing some of the CO2 from the source before emitting it to the atmosphere. [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_scrubber)
* **Afforestation:** Afforestation is the establishment of a forest in an area where there was no previous tree cover. Tree-planting campaigns are sometimes criticized for targeting areas where forests would not naturally occur, such as grassland and savanna biomes. Afforestation can negatively affect ecosystems through increasing fragmentation, edge effects, and making the surface albedo darker (especially in northern regions).

I'm extremely pro-science and analytical. I don't think based on emotions at all and am here to genuinely learn from individuals more intelligent than me on this topic. I also trust that humans are impacting the climate.

&#x200B;

My main question is, how do we know how much impact humans are having on the climate. Not whether we are, or are not...but by how much.

I've seen the NASA graphic that shows how much more CO2 is in the atmosphere over the last 50 years, but are we using a different form of measurement in modern history versus how we speculate/measured it over generations before which could learn to large margins of error? This is possibly not true at all, but these are the types of questions I'm seeking to understand.

Also, I'm under the impression that other major climate changes were due to variations in orbit and so therefore there are other potential impacts on climate change outside of CO2. This would put some level of uncertainty on what magnitude of impact we have on climate change due to other outside factors?

&#x200B;

I assume there is not an exact amount that we can correlate human impact to climate change, but I'm curious at what level of certainty are we with what level of magnitude? Are we 99% certain that we are the cause for 75% of the temp increases, etc.? I assume that confidence level diminishes the higher we hypothesize the impact.

&#x200B;

Any insight would be great! Or if I need to move to another area for understanding, let me know!

To me, it seems that the wider public can almost be split into three camps at this point:

There are the denials, who seem to be able to ignore reality.

Then there are the people who kind of realize that climate change is a major threat that needs to be dealt with. But as long as people fly a bit less and gradually switch to electric cars and do some fine tuning, everything will be fine. 

Then there are people who see it as an existential threat in the very near future.

I just feel that what would be needed to save humanity, would be a 180 degree turn. That there is no time to wait until 2050 or so to become carbon neutral.

Arctic ice is declining year by year. Mass extinctions are well underway. Permafrost is melting. Seasons have become less reliable. I live in Finland, and last year it is fair to say that we did not have a real winter. 

I am only 26, and yet I have seen a marked change even during my lifetime. Example: as a child and teenager, I used to play a lot of ice-hockey outside during the winters. Last several years the temperature has not been reliably below freezing for extended periods, so ice-hockey season has become weeks instead of moths. Instead of reliable less than -5, we often get spikes above 0, which ruins the ice. 

Silly example maybe, but that is an example of how I don’t understand how people don’t see what is happening right in front of our eyes.

I have read a fair bit of Guy McPherson, Paul Beckwith and others. I’ve also read that they are too alarmist, but I have not read any proper debunking of their positions. Especially global dimming seems to turn our situation to a catch-22, but that is almost never discussed in the mainstream.

Fundamentally, I am a person who wants to have a family at some point. But I have given up hope on that. I have also given up hope on reaching 40 years of age myself. For the last year and a half, I have become cynical and lived as if in hospice.

I am not new to climate issues. I remember first being disillusioned in 2009 when the Copenhagen summit was hyped up and then led to no action. 

I have tried to find optimism, but I have failed. I see Paris climate accord as a delusional hope, and yet almost all countries are even failing to keep on track with those demands.

I guess what I look for, is people who are informed, but not pessimistic.

I have a few question about climate change for a project I'm working on. I know they might be very broad arguments and that there is no straight answer but I would appreciate having a discussing on this matter.

How would biomes in different climates change? For example: Would a temperate climate, such as Britain's, become more arid? How does research suggest it would change the landscape? Would vegetation die and leave dry lands or would it be substituted by vegetation that can better cope with the new climate?

Would you still be able to see the sun or would the sky be filled with a thick layer of clouds?

How would oxygen levels change? How could humans and animals adapt to those changes?

How high would radiation level rise? Would this make it impossible for humans to walk outside without protection?

I might have other questions later.

Small introduction, I was raised in a conservative family and among the many tenants I was brought up under, “global warming isn’t real” was one of them. Now, I’m not disparaging my family, and I’m quite proud of how they did their best to raise me, and I still am comfortable and confident in many of my beliefs that I’ve established for myself in adulthood (I say this not to start any political debates, but to try to head off any “glad you escaped, they’re so backward” comments. Not why I’m here, please keep those kinds of politics to a minimum out of respect for others and the sub’s rules.) 

So all of that said, I’m really trying to be more open minded and aware of things, and I would like to read up more on the current science, the evidence we have for the current science, and general projections of what it looks like regarding climate change. What are we doing that’s causing damage, what can we do to fix the damage, what does the damage even look like, that sort of thing. 

My only request is that the resources be as unbiased as possible. Again, I’m not trying to be political, and that’s not what I mean by this. I just mean that a resource from someone’s “climate blog” or some such—even if they’re easy to understand and correct—will be very offputting to me if they’re also really preachy about it. I’d like to start with facts before getting too deep into someone’s opinions on those facts. 

I promise this is coming from a place of genuine interest and open-mindedness, I just know myself and will probably be *more* put off by a climate doomsday preacher (no matter their accuracy) than I would by scientific publications or less biased science communicators. 

So any help y’all can provide would be welcome! Journals, unbiased blogs, articles, YouTube videos, Netflix documentaries, hit me with your best stuff. Please!",43,31,1678740847.0

That's about the entire yearly budget. And say for instance me living in Sweden and wanting to visit America. I can't do that by train.

Then there's also the food. A vegan diet accounts for about 0.5 ton of emissions per year. That's also a huge part of the yearly budget.

It's things like these that make me think we're fucked. There's no way we're going to stop all of the worlds people from flying and beginning a vegan diet. If we're not necessarily fucked, why?

And can you provide some kind of resource/book with data so that one can calculate and manage one's own emission budget? If possible, I'd like to eat meat, and travel.",25,20,1572798329.0
9qir3o,climate_science,Is there any actual scientific debate against climate change?,monkeychess,https://www.reddit.com/r/climate_science/comments/9qir3o/is_there_any_actual_scientific_debate_against/,"I'm an engineer and frequent a technical forum eng-tips.com. Recently a few posts there have spawned climate change debates and honestly I've been surprised how many people with strong technical backgrounds refute the science and claim it is literally a massive conspiracy.  
  
One common theme is that ""science"" is being manipulated by politics to push reports/studies for climate change to line the pockets of people in the business of dealing with pollution.
  
Another one is that essentially ""there is no scientific consensus on climate change and scientists who speak against it are pushed out"".
  
Based on some cursory research it appears that this is much impossible to defend. Yes, companies involved in technologies to combat pollution will make money. The scientific community appears to be united numerous nations have agreed that it is an issue.

Does anyone have any thoughts on this?  Are there some studies that suggest we can in fact mitigate climate risk in the US (factoring in places like Russia and China who also don't appear to take it seriously at all)?

This can include information about climate change itself, or something tied to a specific change related to climate destruction (e.g. reduce waste)

I have a ton of different topic ideas, and I was hoping to get an idea of what others think might be a good choice: 

Option 1) A video on bidets. Pros: potential for humor, informative for other Americans who don't know much about bidets, saves paper

Option 2) A video on moving from being interested in participating in advocacy around climate change to actually participating. This came from a recent survey report from a center at Yale that indicated that only 1% of Americans have participated in something like that, despite 30% saying that would like to.

Option 3): A video on climate change anxiety in millennials and younger. Relatable. 

Option 4): A video about the Green New Deal (could be tied to the advocacy video)

Options 5) A video about the massive (estimated) impact on having kids on one's carbon footprint. Could emphasize importance of considering adoption or foster care instead of having kids 

Option 6) a video about climate change action distractions. Pros: rhymes and could touch on why the straw bans were more of a distraction and harm to disabled folx than an environmental benefit. 

Option 7) A video reframing carbon footprint as an annual carbon ""budget"" that folx are in debt too. Pulls on concept of using up resources each year faster than the earth can renew them. 

Option 8) How to take with climate change deniers. This is a hard one, but close to home thanks to some family members.

hxmsby,climate_science,How will climate change affect winter storms and swell?,bottles24,https://www.reddit.com/r/climate_science/comments/hxmsby/how_will_climate_change_affect_winter_storms_and/,"

I asked a similar question in r/surfing a couple of months ago:

How will the pole‘s ice melting affect the low pressure systems, known in the surfing world as ground swell( huge storms traveling between 30 degrees latitude and 60 degrees latitude),especially in the northern hemisphere?

With the ice of the poles melting, the temperature difference between the poles and the mid lattitudes in the air will likely decrease. This will in turn produce less big storms in Winter, which will ultimately produce less ground swell all around the world, but in particular in the northern hemisphere. Here the ice is melting first. 

That’s what i think could be happening. I read articles that stated storms will get more extreme. But i think that is only true for tropical storms. 

What do you think?
How will this affect the waves and Surf all over the world? In particular Europe and Northern America ? Do you agree with my hypothesis?
I for my part could imagine, we will not be able to see a change happening in the next 10-20years, but ultimately groundswells will get weaker over time. Cyclones and warm weather storms might occur more frequent.",8,4,1595684014.0
