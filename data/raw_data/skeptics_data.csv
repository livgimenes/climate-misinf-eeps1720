g92zos,climateskeptics,Tipping Points and Climate Change,LackmustestTester,https://www.reddit.com/r/climateskeptics/comments/g92zos/tipping_points_and_climate_change/,"The notion of climate system tipping points was used for the first time by Professor Hans **Joachim Schellnhuber**, an internationally renowned climate scientist and founder of the **Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research**, in an interview with BBC reporter Alex Kirby at the **2004** European Open Science Forum in Stockholm

[Metaphor Between Science and the Media, 2018](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17524032.2017.1410198).

> Since 2005, the tipping point metaphor has been used deliberately by climate scientists to convey a warning that abrupt, irreversible and dangerous climate change is imminent. **The metaphor was picked up by the news media (prior to the publication of the scientific articles)** and developed into a commonly used metaphor about **possible, grave dangers of on-going climate change**. Here, we observe that the tipping point metaphor functions as a deliberate boundary object between science and the news media on climate change, on the one hand guiding the conceptual development within the sciences and on the other facilitating **communication of abrupt climate change across the sciences and lay audiences**.

> The tipping point phrase represents a less common example of how metaphors generally travel between the sciences and news media. **Typically, metaphors between science and the public domain start their journey as new terms in developing scientific theory**, and may then be taken up as pedagogical tools to communicate complex phenomena to the public (Deignan, Littlemore, & Semino, 2014, p. 99). The tipping point metaphor is an example of the less common reverse journey, **beginning as a rhetorical device to communicate the dangers of abrupt climate change to the public (in 2005–2007) and then developing into a theory-constitutive metaphor in the climate sciences (2007 onwards)**. While the exegetical function of the metaphor aims at explaining the underlying process to others, in the theory-constitutive phase, **the metaphor starts shaping a subdomain of climate science.**

> Mapping the tipping point phrase in the climate change debate hence reveals a wide range of crucial target domain implications and questions for both scientists, journalists, decision-makers and the general public. [...] By explicating the complex ways in which the tipping point phrase in the climate change debate draws upon these metaphorical possibilities, we hope our article can help both scientists and journalists in managing their language use in important public debates.

[ESD Reviews: mechanisms, evidence, and impacts of climate tipping elements, 2020](https://www.earth-syst-dynam-discuss.net/esd-2020-16/esd-2020-16.pdf), Wang and Hausfather

> Overall,  our  synthesis  highlights  that  tipping  elements  will  play  a  climatically  significant  role over  the  course  of  the  21stcentury, but that the **possibility of a “tipping point cascade” driving a couple or more degrees of additional warming over the next century remains unlikely.**

In 2020, 15 years later, they are still described as the great [""unknowns""](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/33/8252).

9o6igx,climateskeptics,Getting my argument with climate change believers down to a more concise response.,Runner_one,https://www.reddit.com/r/climateskeptics/comments/9o6igx/getting_my_argument_with_climate_change_believers/,"I have been arguing with the **true believers** for some time now. I posted a commentary here some months ago that brought the haters out of the woodwork. 

But since that time I have been accused of posting a wall of text or drowning people with [gish-gallop](https://speakingofresearch.com/2012/09/11/gish-gallop/). 

Even though the reasons for my own climate skepticism is the overwhelming amount of data to the contrary, i has become clear that hitting climate change believers with too much data simply overwhelms their fragile psyche. Often, by their responses, it is clear that they do not, or can not, read and comprehend when presented with so much data. So I have attempted to narrow my argument somewhat. I try to focus on the most oblivious failed predictions, focus my response to their fears, (if they so indicate), and most outrageous lies.
 
I don't know if it works, but if I can persuade just one person to dig deeper, I think the effort is worth it. 

Below is copy pasta of my most recent response to a [snarky response](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/9o2keb/polar_bears_could_face_extinction_as_emergency/e7rlxv9/)  to one of my comments. It's still a little long, but I try to make my point, I doubt it will make any difference but hope springs eternal.  

What do you think, how can we appeal to their logic? What other suggestions do you have to, at least, get them to pay attention to your argument?  


-------------------------------Copy Pasta--------------------

I really do not see how anyone with a reasonable level of open mindedness can still believe this. For over a hundred years the doomsayers have been promising death and destruction, yet for that same hundred years quality of life has improved for the vast majority of civilized mankind.  

Look at just a few of the quotes from the past 100 years: 

""Human race will have to fight for its existence against cold."" Los Angles Times 1912, ""Hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death."" Paul Ehrlich 1968, ""100-200 million people per year will be starving to death during the next ten years."" Paul Ehrlich 1970, ""A billion people starving."" Fortune Magazine 1974, ""Mass deaths by starvation."" New York Times  1974, ""Entire nations wiped off the face of the Earth by rising sea levels if the global warming trend is not reversed by the year 2000."" Noel Brown, director of NEP 1989. 

And then there is [this gold one from 2016: Guy McPherson, author of Going Dark, has predicted the extinction of human beings, by the middle of 2026.](https://www.straight.com/news/868051/could-abrupt-climate-change-lead-human-extinction-within-10-20-years).

I could go on for days. The **experts** have been saying that millions are going to die! It has always been a message designed to play on people's fears. 

Humans are going to be fine, oh we may have to make a few adaptations, but humans are the most adaptable species on the planet, except for maybe cockroaches. 

Dealing with climate change has been a fact of life on this planet since before the first living organisms crawled out of the muck. It has been observed since the dawn of science that species who cannot adapt invariably go extinct. 

Instead of wasting our time fighting over imagined control of something that has been going on without us for millions if not billions of years, we should put our energy in to adapting.

I also don't worry about the economical impact, if anything there should be even more jobs to be had as we adapt to the changes. And worry over conflicts and wars caused by climate change is somewhat of a non-sequitur.  Conflicts and wars have always been, and will always be a part of mankind's existence.

Sure some species my not adapt and go extinct. Guess what; species go extinct all the time, as much as [99.9%  of all species that have existed on Earth are now extinct](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/extinction/massext/statement_03.html).

As species that can not adapt go extinct, other species will move up the chain to take their place. And new species will come into existence as subspecies continue to evolve and become distinct species.

Stop worrying so much, get out and live life.

>**The IPCC Dismissed or Ignored Volcanism, Solar Activity, Rapid Climate Change, and the Little Ice Age in Its Risk Assessments**  
>  
>The purpose of this section is to help you understand that major climate risks have been ignored, downplayed, or dismissed by the IPCC in the climate assessment reports it has provided to governments since 1990. The citations provided below show you exactly where to look in the IPCC’s 1,000–1,500 page documents, so you may see firsthand exactly what they ignored, downplayed, or dismissed. Given the fact that governments have almost unanimously endorsed the IPCC’s climate change science and risk assessments, there are consequences to these omissions—omissions that have left *our global society blind to the full scope of climate and solar activity-related risks.*  
>  
>The IPCC tell us that they have only assessed risks that represent severe impacts relevant to Article 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Article 2 concentrates the IPCC’s focus on dangerous human interference with the climate system. That is to say, the IPCC ignores or dismisses the climate risks attributable to nature. Article 2 has among its objectives the stabilization of greenhouse gases, while ensuring global food production and sustainable economic development.  
>  
>The IPCC predicts, with a high confidence, flooding due to sea level rise and increased storm surges. We are told that flooding, drought, and rain extremes will increase the risk of food insecurity, which will vary geographically. Drought is expected to impact water availability, with consequences on food production, water security, and on the survival of populations living in drought areas.  
>  
>We are told that the displacement of people will increase, as will the risk of violent conflicts. The IPCC informs us of the likely loss of, or damage to, coastal ecosystems due to sea level rise and ocean acidification, which will lead to species extinctions and reduced biodiversity.  
>  
>The IPCC also tells us that the global risks will vary depending on the level of greenhouse gas emissions reached. Higher emissions are expected to exacerbate all risks identified, especially species extinctions, global food security, and normal human activities. We are told that risks will be substantially reduced under a low emission scenario, which is supposed to help motivate us to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.  
>  
>The IPCC’s recent assessment reports (in 2014 and 2012) were reviewed for their assessment of the risk of rapid or abrupt climate change. The IPCC’s review of abrupt or rapid climate change was restricted to a special kind of rapid climate change event, referred to as Dansgaard-Oeschger events that occur in the depths of an ice age after the northern ice caps have formed.  
>  
>The IPCC’s climate risk assessment did not detail the civilization-destroying and population-culling rapid climate change events known to have occurred after the Holocene Climate Optimum. These included the 8.2, 5.9, and 4.2 kiloyear rapid climate change events, the Little Ice Age, and the numerous climate-forcing volcanic eruptions that took place during the Current Era, all of which are highlighted below.  
>  
>The IPCC’s dismissive assessment of Little Ice Age climate history and its associated volcanism means we have not had our “upright attention” drawn to the catastrophic impact of climate change-induced cold, drought, and famine on the populations of China, Europe, Mesoamerica, etc. at that time. During these climate-related crises and catastrophes up to half the population in the affected areas died, and this happened on more than one occasion during the Little Ice Age (see below).  
>  
>This failure to review rapid climate change risks occurred despite numerous eminent solar scientists expert in climate change warning of a return to Little Ice Age-like conditions during this grand solar minimum.  
>  
>The IPCC cautioned the reader in concluding that social unrest, political instability, and warfare during the Little Ice Age could occur today based on historical precedent. This caution was justified by the IPCC because the precise causal pathways linking climate change to these societal changes in historical societies are not well understood (see the citation note on confirmation bias).  
>  
>Surprisingly, in the IPCC’s 2012 special report titled, “Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation,” we are informed the IPCC did not assess the existence of climate system tipping points, and the risks of abrupt and irreversible changes to the climate system. Two years later, in their fifth assessment report, they cited *a low confidence in the science that an abrupt or rapid climate change will occur during the 21st century*, effectively dismissing the possibility.  
>  
>One very important point to understand is that while the IPCC recognizes that volcanic activity can have a dramatic impact on the global climate (i.e., cooling), their climate forecasts do not include the occurrence of climateforcing volcanic eruptions. This is in spite of Rinjani and other climateforcing volcanism triggering and propagating glacier ice accumulation. (see Chapters 5 and 7).  
>  
>A key word search of the 2012–2014 IPCC assessment reports confirms that no risk assessment of climate-forcing volcanic eruptions or super volcanism was provided, or any review provided of their potentially devastating impact on the climate system and on global food security (Chapter 5 and below).  
>  
>The role of the sun (solar irradiance), sunspots, magnetized solar wind (i.e., solar flares, coronal mass ejections) and their connection with earth systems (Chapter 6), was dismissed, downplayed, or ignored by the IPCC’s assessment report (released in 2014). The term grand solar minimum (or minima) is mentioned only three times in the 1990–1992 and 2012–2014 assessment reports; it is referred to twice without description or explanation, and once in a citation.  
>  
>The purpose, therefore, of the remainder of this chapter is to draw your attention to the wealth of scientific literature relating to the solar activity, climate, and volcanic related-risks, all of which have been ignored, downplayed, or dismissed by the IPCC.

12rk2uh,climateskeptics,Climate change rhetoric,stisa79,https://www.reddit.com/r/climateskeptics/comments/12rk2uh/climate_change_rhetoric/,">Climate services focus on users with specific needs for climate information, but most people learn about climate science findings from media coverage... Also, some media outlets have recently adopted and promoted terms and phrases stronger than the more neutral ‘climate change’ and ‘global warming’, including ‘climate crisis’, ‘global heating’, and ‘climate emergency’ (Zeldin-O’Neill, 2019). Google searches on those terms, and on ‘climate action’, increased 20-fold in 2019, when large social movements such as School Strikes for Climate gained worldwide attention (Thackeray et al., 2020). We thus assess that specific characteristics of media coverage play a major role in climate understanding and perception (high confidence), including how IPCC assessments are received by the general public.

12dt8ya,climateskeptics,a bit of philosophy: climate change alarmist's concepts of Time maybe partly what drives them,pr-mth-s,https://www.reddit.com/r/climateskeptics/comments/12dt8ya/a_bit_of_philosophy_climate_change_alarmists/,"I base this first on that they don't care about past alarmist predictions (which they would not if Time was not passing) and second that in older periods of History concepts of Time were different, and different in different ways. Below I tentatively suggest a grouping of climate alarmists.

But first,  what they have in common. They all seem to want to have climate never change (even though it always has). If it is a Timelessness they want to satisfy then if climate never changes, a 'permanant now' culture  would be much more possible. 

Now for what might be different 

- super-rich alarmists  are like ancient Athenians at that empire's height. All of the famous ones 2500 years ago or so  owned slaves and did not value labor, For them the 'Platonic Ideals' descended (as it were) from above - permanent and Timeless. today  Soros, Gates, and the other billionaire alarmists  also seem to not value labor and perhaps for them the atmospheric gases and the weather are what is above as heavenly C02 PPM Ideals. ... Additionally, if Time stops they can imagine themselves immortal.

-  the Green voters seem to want Timelessness - but for a different reason. They do [correctly] value labor, especially their own labor has value is essential to them [right on to that]. They clearly are not neo-Athenians - rather act more medieval ... All European medievals lived in a permanent now, seasons were what mattered to them (not calendar years). The paintings from the period had a sense of Phantom Time. For example they considered the Romans to just as well have happened a few years before. ... Similarly the Greens today feel slavery in the USA  just as well have been a few decades ago (and the civil rights of the 1960 to just as well have been a few years ago). They are oppressed just as they always have been. Their labor is dignified and immortal. .. however if climate changes that's a marker for time passing and life feels more meaningless.

Maybe this is wrong. Maybe I will think about it more",3,35,1680805711.0

11i2uwq,climateskeptics,Climate Change for Dummies,StedeBonnet1,https://www.reddit.com/r/climateskeptics/comments/11i2uwq/climate_change_for_dummies/,"  

All of us are ignorant about most things. The universe is boundless, while our brains and our time on Earth are extremely limited.

That is why Socrates famously was quoted as asserting that he was “wise, as he knew that he knew nothing”.

Most men assume they are wise because they know things, while true wisdom is recognizing the limits of one’s understanding.

Of course, as beings who must live in the world and make decisions, we are required to make considered judgments about the way things are, so the wisdom of the active person is to act based upon evidence and beliefs based on that evidence, and then adapt to circumstances.

That’s a long way of saying that it drives me bananas when I have a conversation with people who are Absolutely Certain they know things about which they could not possibly be certain. Worse, it is infuriating to get lectured by people who have no idea at all about the subject they are passionately lecturing about.

Which brings us to, among other things, the climate change absolutists. As a scientist, I am perfectly willing to examine the evidence, listen to theories, explore what is known, what is deduced, what is supposed, and what we are only guessing at, and consider competing arguments. Yes, I am a medical doctor, but I also hold a bachelor of science in biochemistry, molecular biology, and genetics. I’m a scientist. I like data.

Despite that, although by no means am I what the fanatics would call a “denier.”, I am reflexively given that pejorative by people like adolescent Swedish demagogues and US Congressmen with associate’s degrees in communications with a minor in African art history.

Rather, I am a skeptic of what I have been told: of the data, (the volume and longevity of which are confounders) of the reliability of the models, (which exclude certain variables, like the sun, which are heavy influencers of climate), and also of the scale of whatever problems may arise from anthropomorphic activity. But I don’t scoff, because, as a scientist, I think the data is inadequate. I know that I don’t know enough to be certain of anything.

I keep “following the science”, as the phrase has been coined. But unlike the people who so commonly bandy about that phrase, I actually do follow science, which I understand. Its power AND its limitation. Eventually, our available science will get good enough to make decent predictions, I hope. We aren’t there yet, however.

One of the reasons I am quite frustrated by all the furor over climate is because of how droolingly ignorant almost everybody panicking about the the changes in Earth’s climate at geological timescales are. We keep hearing about temperature trends over decades, and occasionally centuries, but almost nobody talks about the actual timescale at which climate change takes place. We only have reliable climate “data”, such as it is, for the last few thousand years, of which there is only detailed data for the last hundred or so. And even that is extrapolated from a limited number of strategically placed monitoring devices worldwide, or non-scientifically recorded anecdotal analog data by scientists before there were such things as computers or fields of data analysis.

Everybody is freaking out about a degree or two in temperature, and very small increases in sea level.

It’s a joke, and there is a term for this in the realm of statistics: “statistically insignificant”

Sorry, it is. We have no idea what the significance is of changes in 10,000 year old ice core samples from Antarctica in a planet 4.6 billion years old. Is this aberrant? Part of a normal cycle? Related to solar activity? We have no idea, and scientists who claim they do are simply lying to you; presumably for either ego or political demagoguery purposes. Only a few thousand years ago the sea level was about 400 FEET lower than today, much of North America was buried under a mile or more of ice, and human beings were crossing land bridges to settle new continents.

We were at a glacial maximum not that many generations ago, according to existing data. As things warmed up things changed dramatically, and generally for the better if you are…well…….alive. It turns out that most living things don’t like things like being buried under glaciers. Who knew?

We are not talking about millions of years ago. This isn’t plate tectonics. Human beings watched the floods that opened up the English Channel and the connection of the Mediterranean to the Atlantic Ocean. Human beings walked to North America on a land bridge from Asia. The map of the Earth we see today has been vastly different within the lifespan of the human race.

Human eyes, in North America, saw glaciers that were miles high and temperatures that were wildly colder than today. So don’t whine about human extinction from a small increase in sea levels, melting ice, or a degree and a half of temperature increase. Stop the insanity and histrionics, please.

It is palpably absurd.

All this is to say that it’s increasingly annoying to have a conversation with somebody about Earth’s climate when they haven’t got a clue about the Earth’s climate history. It would be like a religion, if they believed in religion. It’s peculiar that the same people always seem to come down on the same side of both of those issues.

Now, the theory that increases in CO2 in the atmosphere would lead to increased global temperatures is based on physics and hence is hardly implausible. I don’t dispute the physics, although no model in today’s computers is sophisticated enough to actually make any predictions. The climate is ridiculously complex, and we simply don’t understand or even measure all the important variables.

But I am willing to listen. Eager to listen. Interested in the theories. But those theories are as well developed as our theories of what happens when two black holes collide–we have nice, very simple stories that get some of the broad strokes, but hardly a comprehensive understanding. This is why we keep hearing about new discoveries, and theories and invest billions in new space telescopes, but also why we should tread carefully in basing massive generational policies, the impact of which we have only begin to appreciate, on such limited understanding.

The belief that modest increases in atmospheric temperatures will lead to a global disaster and mass extinction is based upon voodoo and nothing more. We are currently in what is likely to be a short interglacial period (we are technically still in an Ice Age), and the current global temperature is still lower than it was in the last interglacial period. This is not new science.

Global temperatures today, in other words, are below average compared to most of the time life has existed on Earth. The Earth is not burning, but still shivering.

Unless there was a great mass extinction 140,000 years ago–and there wasn’t–the likelihood that reaching the same global temperatures as happened then or 340,000 years ago seems like not much to worry about. Last I checked, human beings walked the Earth 140,000 years ago, and our hominid ancestors did 340,000 years ago.

These are long time periods by human standards, but they are a blink of an eye in geologic terms, or in the history of life on Earth. The available data simply DOES NOT GO FAR ENOUGH BACK to make reliable models or predictions. Certainly not with the confidence interval upon which to base massive and devastating economic and societal upheaval by enacting shortsighted and overweening governmental public policies.

So how am I supposed to listen to and take seriously anybody who breaks down in tears fearing a degree or two in temperature increase? How seriously should I take policymakers that predict the end of life on earth in eight years when even the most die-hard cynical apocalyptic climate model makes no such prediction, not even close, in the next hundred years? These people, frankly, clearly have no idea of what they speak. Climate fanatics are insufferable; mostly because they talk so much and know so little.

I once, in the not too recent past, had a conversation with a very smart colleague who was leaving medicine to run a nonprofit that pushed for renewable energy. He lectured me for almost an hour about the melting of the Arctic and how it would raise sea levels. After listening politely, I pointed at the glass of water in which the ice had melted.

The level at which it was filled hadn’t changed. Because no water was added to the glass as the ice melted. Try it. Floating ice has the same mass as meltwater and adds nothing to sea levels as it melts. The melting of the Arctic sea ice is, literally, irrelevant to sea levels.

Obviously, if a glacier melts and flows from the land to the ocean that adds to the total volume, but this man lecturing me–who actually advised the legislature on energy policy and climate change–had no idea that the Arctic ice is floating and, frozen or liquid, would add nothing to sea levels. Y’know…..because physics.

Needless to say, our conversation ended there. Neither of us had changed the others’ mind, of course. But at least I temporarily humiliated him, and perhaps prompted him to think critically, so it was a good day.

We are lectured to worry about climate change and devastating losses in biodiversity. So I invite people to visit my state of Ohio, which was buried under a glacier not so long ago, and then visit the equatorial rain forests.

Then come back to me and explain how I should be concerned that Ohio’s biodiversity would decrease because of increased temperatures. I’ll wait.

Because…wait for it…..most biodiversity occurs where it is warmer. Which is easy to explain—everything about life is about energy, from the mitochondria and cell to complex ecosystems. Energy not spent on keeping yourself warm is energy you have to spend elsewhere: pursuing food, bolstering your immune system to fight disease, learning new skills, reproducing.

I freely admit that I am ignorant of what changes the environment will see with a degree or two of increased temperature, and also admit the possibility that human activity might contribute to such an increase.

And I will do so right after climate fanatics admit that reduced fossil fuel use would lead to the starvation and death of billions of human beings right here, right now. In addition to completely abstaining from fossil fuels or any product of them. Because without fossil fuels human beings would not only be infinitely poorer, but most of us would be dead. Frozen, starving, or dead of disease, or of any number of other horrors.

In short, anybody who ignorantly but confidently yells “the Science!!™” while knowing almost nothing about the actual science, studies, or models is not only insufferable, but childish. An Ohioan, living in a spot that was recently buried under a mile of ice, worrying about global warming is a dunce. I invite him or her to spend a year without gas or electricity.

That would last a day or two in our climate. There is a reason why the upper Midwest was still being settled after most of the continent was filling up.

Look at the population of Canada, please. It’s a huge country, yet everybody is clustered at the US border, and “everybody” is comparatively almost nobody because it is too cold to live there.

The population of the Northwest Territories in Canada–a HUGE chunk of land? 45,000 people.

You could dump much of Europe in it. And nobody lives there. Because it is too cold.

I am not opposed to being good stewards of the environment or seeking out renewable sources of energy. But neither am I interested in turning civilization on its head to do so, based on the thinnest veneer of so-called “science”, all the while denying that there are potentially hidden (or not so hidden) unintended consequences of doing so. Take electric cars. You know what there is several hundred pounds of in electric cars? Nickel. Ever been to a nickle mine, where they mine nickel sulfate? There’s nickel ore everywhere. Know what that becomes when it rains? Nickel sulfITE plus….. yes….you guessed it…….sulfuric acid. Go to a nickel mine. It looks like the surface of the moon.

But yeah, sure glad my Prius is saving the planet.

11czuun,climateskeptics,Questions from someone who cares about the environment but has many issues with the climate change narrative,Additional-Ad4887,https://www.reddit.com/r/climateskeptics/comments/11czuun/questions_from_someone_who_cares_about_the/,"Okay so in the interest of transparency I'm going to school for an environmental related degree. I care deeply about the environment and how humans can live with and not apart from the non-human created parts of our world.  Im having a lot of issues with many of the narratives pushed by environmentalists and those I'd consider to be green energy pushers. I've come to this sub-reddit to ask some questions because it seems to be a place where concerns and ideas about the climate change narrative are shared. 

Here are my questions:

Word association: Climate Change

 
 
 
Why did you pick that word/those words?

 
 
 
What is your understanding of the concept/topic of Climate Change?

 
 
 
Does Global Warming mean anything different to you than Climate Change?

 
 
 
What are your issues/concerns when people and politicians talk about climate change?

 
 
 
Earth historically has gone through hot and cold periods (on a geological time scale); we’re currently coming into a warm period.  Do you think humans are having an impact on this warming period?

 
 

If you think the earth is warming, what can we as humans do to slow/stop that process, or do we just let it rock and see what happens? Should we even do anything?

 
 

What is it about certain scientist that make you trust them over others on the topic of climate change? (Hard to know who to trust when a lot of research is funded by industries in fossil fuel/green energy looking for findings that help their bottom line)

 
 
 
Questions you’d like to ask me?
