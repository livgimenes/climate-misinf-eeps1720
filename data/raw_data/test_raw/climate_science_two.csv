"Climate scientists, do you think hyperbole by groups such as Extinction Rebellion is justified?","As a PhD student in climate, I have an internal conflict about the namesake message of groups such as Extinction Rebellion that I am sure other climate scientists are familiar with. On the one hand, as we all know, climate change is a crisis of enormous proportions and I completely support their intentions (I do not want to get into a discussion about methods). 

On the other hand, something that troubles me is that their namesake argument, that climate change represents an ""extinction level threat"" to humanity (with similar messages consistently used in their campaigning) or will lead to the collapse of human civilization is, to put it mildly, not supported by the evidence. In _Global Catastrophic Risks_ (2008), Frame and Allen conclude that, whilst immensely damaging, climate change _""would not necessarily be catastrophic in the sense of being a terminal threat""_ and since this book's publication, I have yet to read a paper arguing that climate change represents an extinction-level threat for humanity.

Of course, the error that Extinction Rebellion (and similar groups) is making is the assumption that the threshold of a catastrophe is human extinction. This is clearly not true because something can be catastrophic to human society (which climate change is) whilst not posing a literal threat to our existence (which climate change does not, or at least there is no evidence for this). 

My question is, is this actually a problem, or is this just academic pedantry? Putting my role as a scientist aside, my worry is that making claims that are _technically_ incorrect (even though the broad message that climate change is catastrophic is correct) makes it easier to deny campaigners' arguments over technicalities rather than actually engaging in the substance of the argument. Or similarly, that laypeople will just dismiss them as fanatics/hysterics. On the other hand, their campaigning does seem to be quite successful (a lot more successful than us climate scientists making technically correct statements on twitter and university press releases) and I haven't actually seen anybody using this counterargument I'm worrying about.

I am processing grief about climate change and at times I wonder if it is rational,"Not sure if this is the right subreddit, but I’ll go ahead.

To me, it seems that the wider public can almost be split into three camps at this point:

There are the denials, who seem to be able to ignore reality.

Then there are the people who kind of realize that climate change is a major threat that needs to be dealt with. But as long as people fly a bit less and gradually switch to electric cars and do some fine tuning, everything will be fine. 

Then there are people who see it as an existential threat in the very near future.

I just feel that what would be needed to save humanity, would be a 180 degree turn. That there is no time to wait until 2050 or so to become carbon neutral.

Arctic ice is declining year by year. Mass extinctions are well underway. Permafrost is melting. Seasons have become less reliable. I live in Finland, and last year it is fair to say that we did not have a real winter. 

I am only 26, and yet I have seen a marked change even during my lifetime. Example: as a child and teenager, I used to play a lot of ice-hockey outside during the winters. Last several years the temperature has not been reliably below freezing for extended periods, so ice-hockey season has become weeks instead of moths. Instead of reliable less than -5, we often get spikes above 0, which ruins the ice. 

Silly example maybe, but that is an example of how I don’t understand how people don’t see what is happening right in front of our eyes.

I have read a fair bit of Guy McPherson, Paul Beckwith and others. I’ve also read that they are too alarmist, but I have not read any proper debunking of their positions. Especially global dimming seems to turn our situation to a catch-22, but that is almost never discussed in the mainstream.

Fundamentally, I am a person who wants to have a family at some point. But I have given up hope on that. I have also given up hope on reaching 40 years of age myself. For the last year and a half, I have become cynical and lived as if in hospice.

I am not new to climate issues. I remember first being disillusioned in 2009 when the Copenhagen summit was hyped up and then led to no action. 

I have tried to find optimism, but I have failed. I see Paris climate accord as a delusional hope, and yet almost all countries are even failing to keep on track with those demands.

I guess what I look for, is people who are informed, but not pessimistic.

"""Climate Change is Junk Science"" - Senator Gerard Rennick","According to a Facebook post published by Senator Gerard Rennick 4 Sept -   


Climate change is junk science. 

The science of heat is governed by the laws of Thermodynamics. 

Heat is kinetic energy, the energy of motion - it does not get trapped by CO2 because it’s a gas. 

Yet this is the theory pushed by the climate change alarmists. 

To describe the impact of CO2 as being like a greenhouse is farcical. A greenhouse works by using a solid object to trap convection before the air cools and condenses. CO2 is not a solid object. 

CO2 absorbs and emits radiation. It does not trap convection. Furthermore it absorbs and emits incoming radiation at 2.8 microns while only absorbing outgoing radiation at 14.8 microns. 

Applying planks rule e = hv, the incoming radiation absorbed by CO2 is 5 times more powerful than the outgoing radiation absorbed. 

Regardless, as Einstein said in 1917, the amount of energy transferred by radiation is so small it always drops out. 

The most powerful form of heat transfer in the atmosphere is convection which is governed by the second law of thermodynamics. The entropy of a system must always increase. 

As such hot air will rise not fall. Outer space is negative 270 degrees Celsius. Our atmosphere is always losing heat because of this differential.

Paper stating we are heading towards RCP 8.5/Worst-Case-Scenario - how legit?,"So at a German press conference of a climate change association, an employee (not sure if expert or not) said that current data from the last 15 years shows that we are on our way to RCP 8.5. Being curious about such a horrendous claim, they've seemed to cite their sources from this paper here: Schwalm, Christopher R.; Glendon, Spencer, and Philip B. Duffy. 2020. “RCP8.5 Tracks Cumulative CO2 Emissions.” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 117 (33): 19656–57 

(I'm not sure if links to the paper are allowed here? I can post a link to that).

But if I may cite the summary of the abstract it says:

""Climate simulation-based scenarios are routinely used to characterize a range of plausible climate futures. Despite some recent progress on bending the emissions curve, RCP8.5, the most aggressive scenario in assumed fossil fuel use for global climate models, will continue to serve as a useful tool for quantifying physical climate risk, especially over near- to midterm policy-relevant time horizons. Not only are the emissions consistent with RCP8.5 in close agreement with historical total cumulative CO2 emissions (within 1%), but RCP8.5 is also the best match out to midcentury in the present circumstances and stated policies with still highly plausible levels of CO2 emissions in 2100.""

My language-ability skills in abstract/sciency English are kind of low, so there was no other way for me than asking it here: Do I (or they on the press conference) understand correctly that according to that one paper (and other data.. at all?) everything is showing towards the high likelihood of the worst-case scenario outcome?",okpmas,85,0.97,12,1626342642.0

"Climate change facts, solutions, and additional resources.","# Facts:

* Daily we emit 117 million tons of CO2. Global CO2 emissions are 43 billion tons each year. [\[S\]](https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-global-greenhouse-gas-emissions)
* As CO2 concentrations build in the atmosphere, infrared light radiated from earth's surface is absorbed by the CO2. Thus trapping heat in earth's atmosphere. This is known as the greenhouse effect. [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect)
* 38% of global CO2 emissions have dissolved in the oceans. When CO2 dissolves in water it forms carbonic acid. This is known as ocean acidification. [\[S\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781856176361000122?via%3Dihub) [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_storage_of_carbon_dioxide) [\[S\]](https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/pubs/outstand/feel2633/feel2633.shtml)
* The ocean has 50 times more CO2 than the atmosphere. The ocean has 39,000 billion tons of CO2. The atmosphere has 750 billion tons of CO2. [\[S\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781856176361000122?via%3Dihub)
* As the ocean becomes more acidic, less CO2 is able to be stored in the water. This leads to CO2 being released from the ocean and sent to the atmosphere. The same goes for ocean temperature. As water temperature rises, less CO2 is able to stay dissolved (e.g. leave a carbonated drink out on a warm day). [\[S\]](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016RG000533)
* As temperatures rise, soil begins to increase the release of carbon in a process known as soil respiration. Researchers estimate soil carbon loss over the 21st century will be equivalent to two decades of carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels. [\[S\]](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aan2874)

# Solutions:

* **Ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE):** Use mafic and ultramafic rocks (olivine, peridotite, etc.) to bind to CO2 and form carbonates. Thus converting CO2 into an alkaline carbonate mineral. These carbonates could then be placed in the ocean to raise the pH and bring it back to normal levels, and increase CO2 storage capacity in the ocean. [\[S\]](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c08561) [\[S\]](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fclim.2019.00007/full)
* **Direct air capture (DAC):** Use large fans to concentrate CO2 into a chamber and then absorb the CO2 by various means. The CO2 can be converted into a long term storage medium such as a carbonate or left as vapor CO2. In the case of vapor CO2 there is some commercial value or it can be pumped into geological wells for storage. [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_air_capture)
* **Renewable energy:** Wind, solar, geothermal, wave/tidal/marine power, etc. [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy)
* **Cultured meats:** Growing meat from cell cultures instead of factory farming. This would free up billions of acres globally, democratize access to protein sources, and eliminate CO2 and CH4 emissions associated with factory farming. In the United States 41% of land use goes towards grazing and animal feed crops. These areas of land are usually high in sunlight and could be used for solar, wind, afforestation, or DAC. [\[S\]](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-economy/land-use-land-value-tenure/major-land-uses/) [\[S\]](https://cellbasedtech.com/lab-grown-meat-companies) [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_agriculture)
* **Reducing fossil fuel emissions:** This can be done by scrubbing some of the CO2 from the source before emitting it to the atmosphere. [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_scrubber)
* **Afforestation:** Afforestation is the establishment of a forest in an area where there was no previous tree cover. Tree-planting campaigns are sometimes criticized for targeting areas where forests would not naturally occur, such as grassland and savanna biomes. Afforestation can negatively affect ecosystems through increasing fragmentation, edge effects, and making the surface albedo darker (especially in northern regions).

I'm an activist with Extinction Rebellion and would like to ask for help with communicating the science of climate change.,"I believe that our planet is facing a climate and ecological emergency that demands an appropriately strong response, and have chosen to work with my local Extinction Rebellion (XR) group to present a version of XR's talk, ""[Heading for Extinction and What To Do About It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaFBnUyDXpk&t=1s)."" Despite the title, the conclusion of this presentation is -not- that we are doomed to certain extinction. As Dr. Kate Marvel has said, ""[HUMANS PROBABLY WON'T GO EXTINCT BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE BUT WE SHOULD SHOOT FOR SOMETHING BETTER THAN ""NOT EXTINCT"" COME ON PEOPLE RAISE YOUR STANDARDS!](https://twitter.com/DrKateMarvel/status/1135637164467863553)""

 I'm aware that there has been some miscommunication of climate science by individuals within XR. The first of XR's demands is to tell the truth about the climate emergency- and that includes accurately conveying the scientific understanding of climate change to a public audience. 

I'm not a climate scientist nor do I have any formal education in climate science. I would like to put out a call for help from individuals who do have such training or are active in climate science who are willing to assist in clarifying questions around climate change from within XR. I would also like to invite and welcome criticism of the scientific basis of XR's communication, as well as my own communication. I think that greater engagement from the scientific community with public communication and social movements acting on climate change has the potential to amplify our effectiveness.

Tipping points: when does a 10% chance become a 100% certainty?,"The links are to good articles on the subject on Grist and Quanta.

In the Grist article, a number of climatologists talk about the tipping points in their respective fields, a decent array, but by no means a majority of the fields encompassing climate change.

A frequent risk assessment of individual areas is put at somewhere around 10% or less probability of occurring, with some discussion of cascade events, one breached tipping point leading to another, but despite the idea of tipping points, all the climatologists still seem to think that changes will be slow on human time scales. But while any individual tipping point may have a low to extremely low likelihood of occurring, if you have enough low-probability possibilities, you wind up with a near 100% chance that *one* of them will happen, which has the potential to raise the probability that others will be more likely to occur.

What I wonder is what happens if a heat dome similar the recent one over Canada (which killed \~1 billion sea animals, likely a tipping point for that ecosystem), and the present one over the Kansas/Missouri/Oklahoma/Texas area, each very low probability events, were to settle over Greenland? It wouldn't need to be as hot to have a major effect: even 5-10C over normal for a week would have profound effects.

There are many other examples. Each month it seems that new factors/feedback loops we hadn't thought of keep emerging, like the melting of the permafrost leading to wildfires which leads to more permafrost melting.

The Quanta magazine article concerns discoveries made over the last decade about carbon sequestration in soils that upends the commonly held notions about how likely we will be able to find ways to put the carbon into it. The problem is that most climate models are using erroneous assumptions about that, leading to over-optimistic assessments.

My point in all this is that we need to stop thinking that severe climate change events are not likely to happen over the next five to ten years, and start assuming that we are currently in a worst-case scenario and act accordingly. If it turns out we overestimated the danger and actually had more time, all's well and good, the only thing ""lost"" is perhaps money. However, if we continue to act as if we were living in a less-than-worst case to much-less-than-worst case, and allow several tipping points to be breached, we won't be able to recover.

Climate change is neither linear nor uniform. Some regional climates are changing much faster than others, and tipping points are far too close for comfort, some timeframes for them are within the margin of error. The entire world needn't hit 2-4C of warming for massive changes and problems to occur. If some regions hit that, then the likelihood of cascade events become far higher.

Encourage climatologists wherever you can to stop talking in terms of centuries and millennia when they discuss climate change, that just makes people dismissive of the subject, because the average person and politician don't care what happens in a century, much less in 10,000 years, they care about what happens this year, next year, and next decade at most. we need to focus on what's happening now, what's going to happen next year, and the next decade, because that's nearly all the time we have left to slow things down enough to have a decent chance at survival. Targeting 2050 is near-suicidal at this point, it virtually guarantees 2C+ of warming by 2040.

We really and truly don't have much time left, and what time we do have can be radically altered if we hit any of those tipping points.",otjlin,43,1.0,3,1627508091.0

Videos on YouTube about Climate Science are dominated by conspiracies,"I recently came across this paper (linked below is a nice summary of it) and it discusses how on YouTube the videos related to climate science are dominated by skeptics and people with crazy conspiracies.  A lot of people use YouTube as a source for news and information, but if all they're getting is misinformation that is a HUGE problem.

They also pointed out that we as scientists need to start taking YouTube seriously as a means to properly educate people on a pretty important issue.

I've already started a Channel where I talk about climate change, sustainability, and solutions (yes shameless plug haha). I think more scientists should follow suit and make their own channels or support good channels that already exist! I feel like there are a lot of us out there on YouTube, we just don't get seen as much because we're not the wild conspiracy theories!

[How conspiracists dominate YouTube climate science content](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/07/190725092525.htm)

I'd also like to hear what your thoughts on this are. How the heck do we handle conspiracy videos when they're the ones screaming the loudest?

Edit: I really can't spell.

Edit 2: I thought I’d also add this because it seems a few people don’t realize this, but there has actually been a big push towards scientists being able to not just do their research, but be able to talk about it to other experts and non-experts alike. 

I’m just finishing up my master’s degree and during both my undergraduate and graduate school educations, I had to take multiple classes where we presented our research in many different formats, including an elevator pitch to non-experts. 

The science community and in particular the meteorology/climatology/sustainability scientific community (which is what my degrees are in), have realized we can’t just do research anymore. We have to be able to explain what it is and why it’s important to children, colleagues, politicians, and sometimes even the random YouTube User. It’s the best way to ensure our research is interpreted correctly and the best way to make sure something is actually done about it!",cndyly,44,1.0,11,1565223405.0

"How to respond to claims made by a ""sceptic"" atmospheric physicist?","I have come across [this video](https://youtu.be/OwqIy8Ikv-c?t=84) in which ""sceptic"" Richard Lindzen states the following about climatological findings:

> We [""sceptics""] note that there are many reasons why the
climate changes -- the sun, clouds, oceans, the orbital variations of the earth,
as well as a myriad of other inputs. None of these is fully understood, and there is no evidence
that CO2 emissions are the dominant factor. But actually there is much agreement between
[the scientific
part of the UN's IPCC - i.e. the Working Group I - (""group one"") and scientists who do not regard anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions as an especially serious problem (""group two"")]. The following are such points of agreement:

>1. The climate is always changing.
2. CO2 is a greenhouse gas without which life
on earth is not possible, but adding it to the atmosphere should lead to some warming.
3. Atmospheric levels of CO2 have been increasing since the end of the Little Ice Age in the 19th century.
4. Over this period (the past two centuries),
the global mean temperature has increased slightly and erratically by about 1.8 degrees
Fahrenheit or one degree Celsius; but only since the 1960’s have man’s greenhouse
emissions been sufficient to play a role.
5. Given the complexity of climate, no confident
prediction about future global mean temperature or its impact can be made. The IPCC, acknowledged
in its own 2007 report that “The long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible.” Most importantly, the scenario that the burning of fossil fuels
leads to catastrophe isn’t part of what either group asserts.

Given the calibre of the ""sceptic"" in question, is the only recourse to verify in the literature each claim - even implicit and general ones that, in turn, contain further claims - in order to see which ones are demonstrably false and post a rebuke with references? Or is there a reasonable wholesale approach in these cases?

Moreover, how should one approach the apparent fallacy whereby any ""sceptical"" scientist, regardless of expertise in climatology,  is given credit in the ""debate,""  and the minimization of the differences within the ""points of agreement""?",otx8ap,41,0.94,59,1627564365.0

Does anyone have some good “starter” resources for climate science for someone who’s been skeptical previously?,"So first of all, hello everyone. Small introduction, I was raised in a conservative family and among the many tenants I was brought up under, “global warming isn’t real” was one of them. Now, I’m not disparaging my family, and I’m quite proud of how they did their best to raise me, and I still am comfortable and confident in many of my beliefs that I’ve established for myself in adulthood (I say this not to start any political debates, but to try to head off any “glad you escaped, they’re so backward” comments. Not why I’m here, please keep those kinds of politics to a minimum out of respect for others and the sub’s rules.) 

So all of that said, I’m really trying to be more open minded and aware of things, and I would like to read up more on the current science, the evidence we have for the current science, and general projections of what it looks like regarding climate change. What are we doing that’s causing damage, what can we do to fix the damage, what does the damage even look like, that sort of thing. 

My only request is that the resources be as unbiased as possible. Again, I’m not trying to be political, and that’s not what I mean by this. I just mean that a resource from someone’s “climate blog” or some such—even if they’re easy to understand and correct—will be very offputting to me if they’re also really preachy about it. I’d like to start with facts before getting too deep into someone’s opinions on those facts. 

I promise this is coming from a place of genuine interest and open-mindedness, I just know myself and will probably be *more* put off by a climate doomsday preacher (no matter their accuracy) than I would by scientific publications or less biased science communicators. 

So any help y’all can provide would be welcome! Journals, unbiased blogs, articles, YouTube videos, Netflix documentaries, hit me with your best stuff. Please!",11qlesq,40,0.95,31,1678740847.0

Was George Carlin right about Plastic?,"Hello all, I've been increasingly distressed about the state of the environment as many of us who are paying attention are, and I came across George Carlin's ""The Planet is Fine"" bit, and he makes mention of how plastic will just become part of the ""new paradigm"". I find the concept reassuring that the planet will heal itself even after humans are gone, but I feel like PFAS and microplastics have made irrevocable harm to the planet that it won't be able to heal. I'd like to hear this community's thoughts on this, and what the science says about the earth being able to heal itself even if humans don't survive. Here's the excerpt I'm referring to: 

""The planet will be here for a long, long, long time after we’re gone and it will heal itself, it will cleanse itself ’cause that’s what it does. It’s a self-correcting system. The air and the water will recover, the earth will be renewed, and if it’s true that plastic is not degradable, well, the planet will simply incorporate plastic into a new paradigm: the Earth plus Plastic. The Earth doesn’t share our prejudice towards plastic. Plastic came out of the Earth; the Earth probably sees plastic as just another one of its children. Could be the only reason the Earth allowed us to be spawned from it in the first place: it wanted plastic for itself, didn’t know how to make it, needed us. Could be the answer to our age-old philosophical question: “Why are we here?” Plastic, assholes!""",12tms0j,40,0.96,10,1682042266.0

Global warming amplified by reduced sulphur fluxes as a result of ocean acidification,"https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1981

A bit of an old one, but it seems every interesting. As you all hopefully know, DMS (dimethylsulphide) essentially cools the atmosphere. DMS is produced by phytoplankton, this study shows that due to ocean acidification (OA), DMS production will decrease, causing an increase in temperature up to 0.48°C.

As you can see in the graph above my text, the trend might either be very sharp, or more shallow, a more dramatic drop might be very bad, meaning that OA will cause a large decrease in DMS and thus a boost to global warming.


This is an interesting mechanism, not included by current models.

However, the jury is still out, this paper shows that while OA will decrease DMS production, warming will increase it.

https://www.biogeosciences.net/16/1167/2019/

This paper shows that OA will decrease DMS concentrations in surface waters.

www.publish.csiro.au/en/EN18186

Edit: Corrected the source

This paper shows that due to Arctic ice loss, DMS production is increasing in the Arctic

https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/09/04/1904378116

Lastly, this paper shows that this may cause a negative feedback in the Arctic.

https://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/19/6419/2019/


In conclusion, it still seems to be open to debate whether DMS production will increase or decrease, and what the effect will be. A really interesting mechanism, possible grounds for geoengineering and further research!",d44tdj,40,0.98,3,1568465704.0

Seeking understanding of human impact on climate change,"Let me preface to say that I'm not in a science field, and that I'm in a tech field. I'm extremely pro-science and analytical. I don't think based on emotions at all and am here to genuinely learn from individuals more intelligent than me on this topic. I also trust that humans are impacting the climate.

&#x200B;

My main question is, how do we know how much impact humans are having on the climate. Not whether we are, or are not...but by how much.

I've seen the NASA graphic that shows how much more CO2 is in the atmosphere over the last 50 years, but are we using a different form of measurement in modern history versus how we speculate/measured it over generations before which could learn to large margins of error? This is possibly not true at all, but these are the types of questions I'm seeking to understand.

Also, I'm under the impression that other major climate changes were due to variations in orbit and so therefore there are other potential impacts on climate change outside of CO2. This would put some level of uncertainty on what magnitude of impact we have on climate change due to other outside factors?

&#x200B;

I assume there is not an exact amount that we can correlate human impact to climate change, but I'm curious at what level of certainty are we with what level of magnitude? Are we 99% certain that we are the cause for 75% of the temp increases, etc.? I assume that confidence level diminishes the higher we hypothesize the impact.

&#x200B;

Any insight would be great! Or if I need to move to another area for understanding, let me know!

Amplified Arctic warming by phytoplankton under greenhouse warming,"[https://www.pnas.org/content/112/19/5921](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/19/5921)

A slightly older paper but a very interesting paper nevertheless, I found it doing research for my upcoming posts on geoengineering.

As the Arctic ice melts, its reflectivity or albedo will decrease. This means that the exposed ocean will warm up more as a result of increased absorption of sunlight. This causes a positive feedback loop where:

Less ice causes the ocean to warm up ---> Warmer ocean water causes more ice to melt ---> More ice gets melted ---> Rinse and repeat.

However, it was believed that this would create a possible upside. Warmer oceans would allow phytoplankton to grow. As the phytoplankton grows, it will absorb carbon dioxide and therefore cool the earth down slightly. 

This paper shows that increased phytoplankton growth could amplify Arctic warming by 20%, causing devastating warming somewhere that is already warming twice as fast as anywhere else on earth. This causes another positive feedback loop where:

Less ice causes the ocean to warm up ---> Warmer ocean water allows more phytoplankton to grow ---> More phytoplankton growth leads to warmer ocean water and therefore less ice ---> Rinse and repeat.

Even if you don't fancy reading the entire paper, please read the abstract and Figure. 4, showing the correlation between phytoplankton density and both ice cover and shortwave radiation.",dc92dz,31,0.9,1,1570016847.0

Should Working Group III be a part of the IPCC?,"There has been criticism by academic commentators that IPCC working group III, dominated by economists and political scientists, bears some responsibility for the absolute failure of the global community halt the rise in CO2 emissions and respond adequately to the crisis, due to severely underplaying of the risk of damages of the climate crisis and promulgation integrated assessment models that rely on the removal of hundreds of gigatons CO2 from the atmosphere by speculative future negative emissions technologies, in order to avoid the challenging problem of real mitigation today. 

The conventional wisdom that 3.5-4C of warming somehow represents a ""cost optimal"" level of heating (for which William Nordhaus was awarded the Economics Nobel) conflicts directly with results from physical climate science - yet appears to enjoy widespread acceptance among economists.

This presentation highlights some of the foundational problems with the conventional economic approach to climate damages put forward by Nordhaus et al: Prof. Steve Keen: [Economists should be removed from the IPCC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=235&v=vwwvZ8g5eHE&t=36s&fbclid=IwAR0C8IQ0xV8OZEf92IFSc9TjyDnzQRsULKm8icN7LiBMvDi7XZREHHcuBI0) The conventional economic approach is misguided, based on made-up data, and following it threatens social disaster.


Prof. Kevin Anderson has argued that [Working Group III should not be part of the IPCC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BZFvc-ZOa8&t=17m22s). According to him, the large scale future reliance on negative emissions technologies by promulgated by integrated assessment modelers is a form of technocratic fraud and constitutes a moral hazard. In his estimation, they constitute a post hoc rationalization of tepid action to mitigate emissions in the present to avoid the politically unpleasant necessity of cutting CO2 emissions at a rate that would interfere with ""fairytales of economic growth""- as [Greta Thunberg recently said in her address to the UN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYqtXR8iPlE&t=35s).",ddaose,31,1.0,12,1570210865.0

How much is 1 Gt Co2e?,"Hey all, 

So I've just finished an essay on the impact feed additives can have in reducing methane emissions in cattle, and I've got the figure that if all the 1.5 b cattle were fed 3-NOP which achieves a ~30% decrease in methane emissions, then a 0.83 Gt Co2e reduction would be caused. 

The thing is, I can't find any papers to give any sort of data to out this figure in perspective. I can find websites which all claim trees absorb different masses of co2 annually, none of which are based on any scientific papers, and I can find any papers with data about the average mass of co2 released annually by diesel cars either.

New here. How can I find the following data please ?,"Hi,

I'm looking for ways to persuade people to take action against the climate crisis (I think we all are). In order to do that, I'd like to express the crisis in non technical terms, but rather than that, in human lives. 

Here is what it would look like :

>Dear fellow human. You probably know that we, as a society, have to reduce our CO2 consumption under X1 ... but if you're like me you don't know what that means. Well, for you, it means that your target should be X2 = X1/numberofhumans. That's equivalent to (blablabla). Is that more clear ? Well, no. I know.  
>  
>So let's frame it otherwise. The consequence of the climate crisis will be very bad, and people will die because of it. How much of them ? Well, it is hard to count, but we can give a reasonable estimate. It turns out that you being personally responsible for a CO2 target of X2 is equivalent to being responsible for the death of X3 adults, X4 children. Worse, X5 time more humans are gonna face war, starvation, or migration to a distinct country because of it.  
>  
>That's a lot of responsibility on your shoulders, and the bad news is, your individual action (being vegan, not using your car, ...) can only cover X6% of the reduction you need to do. The next (100-X6)% has to come from corporations, governments, etc... So, if you care about the lifes of the X3 adults and X4 children you are personally responsible for, you have to fight for them.  You have to force your leaders, governments and companies, to change everything. They can't fight for themselves now. You can. You are their only chance. Do it.

Now, in order to write that with actual figures, I'm looking for the following data :

* X1 - What is our current CO2 consumption, and what it should be (I believe I can find it in the IPCC report. Is it a good source here ?).
* X2 - Easy one, all I need is the number of humans. I can handle it :)
* X3, X4 and X5 are hard. Here, we need to convert climate scenarios into geopolitical ones. Are there scientists who have worked on this, and can provide reasonably realistic estimates (I mean, even order of magnitudes ones). Also, I'm aware I'll need a set target date for this. 2040 ? 2050 ? 2100 ? I think I'll go with the data we have here, depending on the source we can find.
* X6 - What percentage of the CO2 effort can come from individual action (not eating meat, etc...). I believe I've read that the value is around 25%, but I need a source.

I hope some of you can help find this data. It is a small piece of text, but if we can build this, we can also convert any CO2 measurement into an individual count of lifes. It changes the communication game imo.

Thank you for your help,

Regards,

*Note : I'm also aware of a strong bias depending on whih country we're talking about. The world as a whole ? The US ? Europe ? Canada ? The figures aren't the same. That said, I'll take any help you can give, and I'll see what I can write depending on the data we have ... or not :)*",q7ed9d,30,0.97,4,1634141070.0

"When paleoclimatologists say certain periods in deep time were ""ice-free"", to what extent do they mean that? Do they mean, say, that even windward sheltered pockets near the summits of tall High Arctic mountain ranges hosted no glaciers or even seasonal snow at all? That doesn't seem reasonable.","Apologies if this is a stupid question with an answer that may lie right beneath my nose, but I've been wondering this for well over 2 years now.

During the most extreme periods (e.g. the times immediately following the Huronian and Cryogenian glaciation and possibly the end-Permian), a total lack of glaciation *may* make sense, but I struggle to imagine how other greenhouse periods like the mid-Cretaceous, or the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum with its ""mere"" 8 °C warming would fit that description, because of the *sheer margin* by which some places remain within thermal conditions conducive to glaciation on present Earth.

For instance, both Vostok and Plateau Station (at \~3,500 meters elevation) could warm by a whopping *32 °C* before their warmest-month averages peak above freezing. Even if the temperature anomaly at the poles was 3 times greater than the global average, it would seem to me that mountains analogous to the Gamburtzevs (which peak at \~2,700 meters elevation underneath that vague area of Antarctica, equating to being at most \~8 °C warmer according to the temperature lapse rate) should still be able to support alpine glaciation let alone just seasonal snowfall under PETM-like conditions.

And given that locations with winters at least as as warm as Tampico (average temperature in coldest month 18.8 °C) have recorded snowfall while no places with average coldest month temperatures below \~7 °C haven't, the idea that *any* planet cool enough to avoid a Venusian-style runaway greenhouse effect with vaguely Earth-like orbital and rotational properties would *entirely* lack snow and frost appears patently ludicrous.

So, is it thought that small-scale alpine glaciation or at least seasonal snow and frost existed in some of the coldest areas on Earth during those periods? If so, to what extent in each? If not... ***how?!?***",pf1dmn,30,1.0,4,1630396799.0

How much CO2 equivalent is released annually from soil degradation ?,"Currently trying to get my head around how much that could be compared to our emissions, but i'm either missing something or idk... this seems way too high:

https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/soil-carbon-storage-84223790/

Since the begining of the industrial revolution soil degradation added 50-100GT of CO2 to the atmosphere according to that study. For comparison, the total anthropogenic emissions since then were 450GT.

A third of the topsoil has been lost, so 1% topsoil loss should equal 15-30GT of CO2 released to the atmosphere. Our total emissions in 2019 were 36GT.

So how much topsoil do we currently lose each year ?

https://www.sej.org/headlines/only-60-years-farming-left-if-soil-degradation-continues

If the remaining two-thirds of topsoil are gone in 60 years at the current rate, isn't this pretty much a one percent loss each year or around 40-90% of our emissions additionally ?

Climate research related notes for a short film,"Hi everyone,

I need to film a scene in which a ""climatologist"" is writing notes related to his climate research onto a whiteboard.

Does anyone know what I can lay out on the board? It doesn't have to make complete sense, as long as it looks professional.  If someone were to study let's say extreme weather events in a desert environment or even in a European country like Germany (the floods) what values would a climatologist look at to determine the severity and cause of such an event?

Question about forecasting horizons in climate science,"Given that we don't know what humans will do to the climate in the next century or beyond, we can't really predict way into the future without making assumptions.  


But if we removed humans from the equation, like lets say a few million years ago you were trying to predict the future climate with all the data that you generally have when building climate models (how you gathered that data without humans and how you travelled back in time are left unresolved), how far forward could you accurately predict the climate? 1k years, 10k years, 100k years, 1m years, 100 million years?  


Weather forecasts are hard to make far into the future because weather is a chaotic system. Most real world systems are too some extent chaotic at large time scales. At what time scale does chaos or some other difficulty dominate so that the error bars on a climate forecast are basically making your prediction of something between all water boils and all water is frozen?",r01cby,27,0.9,5,1637630538.0
Climate Modelling Software,"This may not be the most appropriate subreddit but I have a problem you might be able to help with.

I'm physicist with an interest in fictional worldbuilding (i.e. r/worldbuilding) and I was wondering whether that was any freely available (desktop) software for climate modelling that could be used to estimate conditions on other planets? In practice this would just mean an alternative time varying insolation pattern and land/ocean distribution to that on Earth.

There is obviously a desire for simplicity but something sufficiently complicated to produce 2D maps of surface temperature and rainfall for varying inputs would be ideal. The focus would be on plausibility rather than accuracy as this would just aim to produce realistic outputs not necessarily the correct output.

If such software isn't available, is there a good reference that describes the various equations that I would have to solve in Python to produce a simple model? I believe I could already do this for temperature but I haven't seen a ""simple"" model that includes rainfall. I appreciate that there may not be a suitably simple model for that though.",qwpic9,27,1.0,8,1637241403.0

How do I respond to a video my family is circulating about Climate Science?,"This video is currently circulating through part of my family:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvO7bBuTRno](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvO7bBuTRno)

I have watched the whole thing, and those of you in the know will probably already know Dr. Christy's main points without needing to rewatch. For those who aren't and would prefer some quick bullet points:

&#x200B;

* According to Dr. Christy's climate data, collected from satellites using microwaves, and focusing on the troposphere rather than surface temperature, the climate has shown negligible varation relative to it's normal amount of variation. He says the troposphere is the only place where we should pull data from to tell if the climate is truly changing and surface temperatures are unreliable because of thermometer placement and fluctuation. (A quick google search will yield many images showing how his data differs from that of the broader consensus on temperature change.)  
 
* Weather events have not increased but stayed normal relative to their usual variations. The heat wave in the 30's was much worse than any heat wave we have recently experienced.  
 
* Coal and Natural Gas are cheaper and more efficient and provide exponentially more energy than solar/wind/etc. Other countries like Japan and Germany are building more and more coal plants. The earth will keep replenishing its supply of carbon and we are finding more and more of it to use. He essentially also says that we aren't going to run out of resources, at least anytime soon, and that human ingenuity will come up with something when we do.  
 
* The sea ice has always been melting and the only ice melting is the surrounding ice sheets, not the actual polar landmasses themselves.  
 
* CO2 is actually a good thing for the planet and will make it greener. Carbon is inherently good.  
 

My question is, being an average person who reads the news as well as a small number of scientific papers, what do I tell these members of my family regarding what Dr. Christy is saying in order to help move them away from this? I am aware of all the basic facts about climate change, and more or less disagree with each of these bullet points; the challenge comes in because as far as these members of my family are concerned, it is basically my word as a non-scientist against the word of a real scientist, who despite his unfortunate stance on this issue, is an incredibly experienced scientist with an extensive resume, particularly when it comes to climate. His point about all the other scientific community being essentially part of a ""conspiracy"" plays right into their hands as well. The fact of the matter too is that I simply don't have enough knowledge or evidence on hand to dispute what he's saying, other than trying to remember that one article/paper I read whenever ago and trying to dig it out and on and on.

What are the realistic best and worst case scenarios for our future?,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this, so please let me know. Also, while I'm open to any answers, I would really appreciate it if people with genuine scientific credentials and/or trustworthy  sources could respond.

I know that climate change is not a binary issue with one or two endings, and I know that accurately predicting Human behaviours is incredibly difficult, so I'm not expecting a perfect answer to this question. 

Having said that:

Based on our current level of emissions, the positive feedback loops we have been able to identify and the direction society seems to be heading, what are the best and worst case scenarios for the environmental crisis? More specifically, within the near to midterms- say 2030 to 2100.

Most of the optimistic scenarios I've seen bandied about involve a sudden political and social shift all over the world; leading governments to rapidly implement all of the Glasgow climate pledges, electrify the grid, cut back on animal agriculture and attain net zero prior to 2050, before using carbon capture and reforestation to restore the Earth back to preindustrial health.

As wonderful as this would be, and as much as we should strive for something like it, it also seems incredibly unlikely. While environmental policies and activism are improving, I can't really see this all happening in such a short time.

On the other end of the spectrum you also have radical pessimists who believe that it's already too late to do anything and that tipping points will devastate the entire planet within the immediate future- leading to the collapse of civilisation by the 2040's (or as soon as 2026 in the most extreme cases) and an end to all life on Earth.

Again, this doesn't seem to be supported by any legitimate scientist. In fact, it has been suggested by several scientists that both blind hope and doomism have been weaponized by the corporate media as a means of sabotaging genuine action.

If we fail to cut back on our emissions and other destructive activities over these coming years and decades, is it plausible that Humans could become extinct? Could positive feedback loops actually render the entire planet uninhabitable?

How can we attain the organised action necessary to get us to a happier ending? What steps do we need to be taking to mitigate global warming, beyond electrifying the grid and phasing out fossil fuels?

Regardless of what we do, it seems certain that things will get worse. What can we do to help one another and our planet's ecosystems adapt?",sssqw9,24,0.85,28,1644894247.0

Peer-Reviewed Studies on the Climate Change Link to Wildfires,"**Overview and Scope**

With the active wildfire season across much of the western U.S., I've been interested in examining the preponderance of evidence on the subject of climate change and wildfire activity over recent times and future projections. The scope of this research focuses mainly on the modern era of the last half century, examining trends and determining the climate signal (if any). The list covers both regional and global studies. It includes attribution of recent observations (mainly last 50 years or so) and future projections. There's no filter on publication date but I'm emphasizing studies over the last decade. 

Research sources include Google Scholar and the IPCC. This is not meant to take the place of any peer-reviewed synthesis report, which have many contributors and reviewers, but hopefully it's helpful to those seeking information on the topic. Hat tip to paleoclimatologist/dendrochronologist Kevin Anchukaitis, who's [thread](https://twitter.com/thirstygecko/status/1022645955441487872) was sort of a catalyst for me to do the research. 

General recommendation for those in the Twittersphere is this [list of a few hundred climate scientists](https://twitter.com/flimsin/lists/climatescientists?lang=en). Common Tweets are citations to recent studies mixed in with daily thoughts and discussion.

Excellent overview by scientist and Berkeley Earth contributor Zeke Hausfather cuts through the political spin:

[https://www.carbonbrief.org/factcheck-how-global-warming-has-increased-us-wildfires](https://www.carbonbrief.org/factcheck-how-global-warming-has-increased-us-wildfires)

Various thoughts: Although related, the set of studies won't cover [global warming's increase in tree pests](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112717306928), which can wreck havoc on forests. There are other big human influences on wildfire trends. Many fires are started by humans and fire suppression can contribute towards reducing/enhancing wildfires at various times. [Land use changes](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2017GB005787) had a strong downward impact on fire activity during the industrial age, along with advances in fire-fighting methods, although data prior to the 1980's is sketchy (see the CarbonBrief article). I find the focus on high pre-industrial wildfire activity to be misguided, sort of like saying accelerating sea level rise is no big deal since glacial transitions often had fairly strong century-level changes. There are a few more humans settled around low-lying areas than 10,000-20,000 years ago. Similarly, with human population far larger and closer to burn areas, risks are multiplied. I suppose one way of limiting wildfire risk is to continue industrial age land use trends and get rid of forests. That solution creates other problems. Limiting the climate impact seems to be a good idea. 

&#x200B;

**Conclusions**

The preponderance of evidence suggests that observations over the last few decades have shown increased wildfire trends in area burned in the western U.S., Canada and Russia with significant attribution to human-induced global warming. Projections indicate a substantially increased trend in wildfire activity over the course of this century in the western U.S., Canada, Alaska, and mid to high latitudes in general, although with regional variation. 

Studies in each section are ordered by most recent. As a large proportion of studies focus on North America, I've created 2 sections: one for North America and one for other regions and global trends.

""Evidence for declining forest resilience to wildfires under climate change"", 2017

""Forest resilience to climate change is a global concern given the potential effects of increased disturbance activity, warming temperatures and increased moisture stress on plants. We used a multi-regional dataset of 1485 sites across 52 wildfires from the US Rocky Mountains to ask if and how changing climate over the last several decades impacted post-fire tree regeneration, a key indicator of forest resilience. **Results highlight significant decreases in tree regeneration in the 21st century. Annual moisture deficits were significantly greater from 2000 to 2015 as compared to 1985–1999, suggesting increasingly unfavourable post-fire growing conditions, corresponding to significantly lower seedling densities and increased regeneration failure. Dry forests that already occur at the edge of their climatic tolerance are most prone to conversion to non-forests after wildfires.** Major climate-induced reduction in forest density and extent has important consequences for a myriad of ecosystem services now and in the future.""

""Impact of anthropogenic climate change on wildfire across western US forests"", 2016

""Increased forest fire activity across the western United States in recent decades has contributed to widespread forest mortality, carbon emissions, periods of degraded air quality, and substantial fire suppression expenditures. Although numerous factors aided the recent rise in fire activity, observed warming and drying have significantly increased fire-season fuel aridity, fostering a more favorable fire environment across forested systems. **We demonstrate that human-caused climate change caused over half of the documented increases in fuel aridity since the 1970s and doubled the cumulative forest fire area since 1984. This analysis suggests that anthropogenic climate change will continue to chronically enhance the potential for western US forest fire activity while fuels are not limiting.**""

""Controls on interannual variability in lightning-caused fire activity in the western US""

""A data synthesis of cloud-to-ground lightning strikes, climate and fire data across the western US from 1992 to 2013 was conducted to better understand geographic variability in lightning-caused wildfire and the factors that influence interannual variability in lightning-caused wildfire at regional scales. Distinct geographic variability occurred in the proportion of fires and area burned attributed to lightning, with a majority of fires in the interior western US attributed to lightning. Lightning ignition efficiency was highest across the western portion of the region due to the concomitance of peak lightning frequency and annual nadir in fuel moisture in mid-to-late summer. For most regions the number of total and dry lightning strikes exhibited strong interannual correlation with the number of lightning-caused fires, yet were a poor predictor of area burned at regional scales. **Commonality in climate–fire relationships for regional annual area burned by lightning- versus human-ignited fires suggests climate conditions, rather than lightning activity, are the predominant control of interannual variability in area burned by lightning-caused fire across much of the western US**.""

""Large wildfire trends in the western United States, 1984–2011""

""We used a database capturing large wildfires (> 405 ha) in the western U.S. to document regional trends in fire occurrence, total fire area, fire size, and day of year of ignition for 1984–2011. **Over the western U.S. and in a majority of ecoregions, we found significant, increasing trends in the number of large fires and/or total large fire area per year. Trends were most significant for southern and mountain ecoregions, coinciding with trends toward increased drought severity. For all ecoregions combined, the number of large fires increased at a rate of seven fires per year, while total fire area increased at a rate of 355 km2 per year. Continuing changes in climate, invasive species, and consequences of past fire management, added to the impacts of larger, more frequent fires, will drive further disruptions to fire regimes of the western U.S. and other fire-prone regions of the world.**""

""Warming and Earlier Spring Increase Western U.S. Forest Wildfire Activity""

""Much of the public and scientific discussion of changes in western United States wildfire has focused instead on the effects of 19th- and 20th-century land-use history. We compiled a comprehensive database of large wildfires in western United States forests since 1970 and compared it with hydroclimatic and land-surface data. **Here, we show that large wildfire activity increased suddenly and markedly in the mid-1980s, with higher large-wildfire frequency, longer wildfire durations, and longer wildfire seasons. The greatest increases occurred in mid-elevation, Northern Rockies forests, where land-use histories have relatively little effect on fire risks and are strongly associated with increased spring and summer temperatures and an earlier spring snowmelt.**""

""Human exposure and sensitivity to globally extreme wildfire events""

""Extreme wildfires have substantial economic, social and environmental impacts, but there is uncertainty whether such events are inevitable features of the Earth’s fire ecology or a legacy of poor management and planning. We identify 478 extreme wildfire events defined as the daily clusters of fire radiative power from MODIS, within a global 10 × 10 km lattice, between 2002 and 2013, which exceeded the 99.997th percentile of over 23 million cases of the SFRP 100 km-2 in the MODIS record. These events are globally distributed across all flammable biomes, and are strongly associated with extreme fire weather conditions. Extreme wildfire events reported as being economically or socially disastrous (n = 144) were concentrated in suburban areas in flammable-forested biomes of the western United States and southeastern Australia, noting potential biases in reporting and the absence of globally comprehensive data of fire disasters. C**limate change projections suggest an increase in days conducive to extreme wildfire events by 20 to 50% in these disaster-prone landscapes, with sharper increases in the subtropical Southern Hemisphere and European Mediterranean Basin**.""

""Global trends in wildfire and its impacts: perceptions versus realities in a changing world"", 2016

**""Instead, global area burned appears to have overall declined over past decades, and there is increasing evidence that there is less fire in the global landscape today than centuries ago**. Regarding fire severity, limited data are available. For the western USA, they indicate little change overall, and also that area burned at high severity has overall declined compared to pre-European settlement. ""

""according to national statistics for the USA, while area burned by prescribed fire has changed little overall since reporting began in 1998 (10 year average: 8853 km2), area burned by wildfires has seen an overall strong trend of increase by over 5% yr-1 over the period 1991–2015""

""**The warming climate, which is predicted to result in more severe fire weather in many regions of the globe in this century \[53\] will probably contribute further to both perceived and actual risks to lives, health and infrastructure.** ""

My comment: At first glance it looks like somewhat of a contrarian paper but many of its conclusions overlap the balance of evidence on the other studies, namely area burned in the U.S. and the impact of climate change on future trends. Much of the study is an exercise in framing with comparison to pre-industrial wildfire activity and other human impacts. IMO, the abstract overstates its case. For example, it brushes aside the 1983-2012 western U.S. increase in area burned as having limited value due to length of record, yet relies on shorter timeframes (such as the 2002-2013 satellite trend) to make its case on global area burned trends. Incidentally, that set of data is also cited by Bowman et al. 2017 above.

""Climate strongly influences global wildfire activity, and recent wildfire surges may signal fire weather-induced pyrogeographic shifts. Here we use three daily global climate data sets and three fire danger indices to develop a simple annual metric of fire weather season length, and map spatio-temporal trends from 1979 to 2013. **We show that fire weather seasons have lengthened across 29.6?million?km2 (25.3%) of the Earth’s vegetated surface, resulting in an 18.7% increase in global mean fire weather season length. We also show a doubling (108.1% increase) of global burnable area affected by long fire weather seasons (>1.0 s above the historical mean) and an increased global frequency of long fire weather seasons across 62.4?million?km2 (53.4%) during the second half of the study period.** If these fire weather changes are coupled with ignition sources and available fuel, they could markedly impact global ecosystems, societies, economies and climate.""

""Climate change and wildfires in Russia"", 2014

""The application of various remote sensing instruments has shown that the **average vegetation wild fire area in Russia for 1998–2010 accounted for 8.2 ± 0.8 × 106 ha, with about two-thirds of wildfires occurring on forest lands and half on the forested lands. The average annual fire carbon balance during the above period was 121 ± 28 Tg C yr-1, including 92 ± 18 Tg C yr-1 emitted from the forested land. The forecasts based on the General Circulation Models suggest the dramatic acceleration of fire regimes by the end of the 21st century. Taking into account the increase in the dryness of the climate and the thawing of permafrost, this will likely lead to a dramatic loss of forested area and the impoverishment of the forest cover over a major part of the forest zone.""**

I have a few question about climate change for a project I'm working on. I know they might be very broad arguments and that there is no straight answer but I would appreciate having a discussing on this matter.

How would biomes in different climates change? For example: Would a temperate climate, such as Britain's, become more arid? How does research suggest it would change the landscape? Would vegetation die and leave dry lands or would it be substituted by vegetation that can better cope with the new climate?

Would you still be able to see the sun or would the sky be filled with a thick layer of clouds?

How would oxygen levels change? How could humans and animals adapt to those changes?

How high would radiation level rise? Would this make it impossible for humans to walk outside without protection?

I might have other questions later.

Climate sensitivity studies since the last IPCC report point towards a higher lower bound,"As an exercise to refresh my knowledge on the latest research, I began putting this list together last week. I subsequently read the Royal Society report on advancements since AR5, which essentially reaches pretty much the same conclusion on climate sensitivity. Low values are less likely. A few studies are indicating higher best estimates and ranges but plenty still point to the mid-range values.

**Scope** 

This lists covers studies published since the IPCC 5th Assessement Report (AR5). This might be a preview of what to expect with AR6. See the Royal Society publication [What have we learnt since the
IPCC 5th Assessment Report?](https://royalsociety.org/~/media/policy/Publications/2017/27-11-2017-Climate-change-updates-report-references-document.pdf) for a much broader scope.

**Summary and Discussion**

Several studies since AR5 have indicated higher sensitivity or range than the general consensus with other studies reaffirming the best estimate and range. Both before and after AR5 there have been a few studies utilizing energy balance models estimating climate sensitivity to be on the low side, but since AR5 a variety of studies have examined these approaches. The general consensus is that simple energy budget models have limitations that inherently bias the true ECS (and in some cases TCR) low. There's enough evidence for the IPCC to adjust the lower bound back up. I've not seen effective critiques of the high-end estimates yet. 
The Royal Society report is consistent with this conclusion.

>In 2013, the IPCC report stated that a doubling of pre-industrial carbon dioxide concentrations would likely produce a long-term warming effect of 1.5 to 4.5°C; the lowest end of that range now seems less likely

>How might this affect the IPCC statement? Growing understanding of the complex, non-linear factors determining climate sensitivity is leading to improvements in methodologies for estimating it. **A value below 2°C for the lower end of the likely range of equilibrium climate sensitivity now seems less plausible.**

I would like to see communication of the IPCC reports better emphasize that values around 3 C are more likely than values around the fringes of their ranges. It's not a distribution of even probability. We're looking at costly [impacts] through essentially all of the ECS range - worse at higher levels obviously.

**Background**

[AR5 diagram of climate sensitivity estimates](http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/figures/WGI_AR5_FigBox12.2-1.jpg)

**Definitions (IPCC)**

ECS (Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity): temperature change after the system has reached a new equilibrium for doubled CO2, i.e., after the additional warming commitment has been realised
TCR (Transient Climate Response): temperature change at the time of CO2 doubling

**Criteria**

This list is intended to cover studies that estimate ECS and/or TCR, mean estimate and/or ranges or lower/upper bound. There are many other studies that may indirectly support feedback strength but I'd rather keep this list manageable.
This list covers studies published in reputable non-predatory journals. I'm mainly sticking to higher Impact Factor journals.

**Format**

The studies are placed into categories.

* Higher estimates - studies notably higher than the generally-accepted ranges (i.e. ECS 1.5-4.5 C) or 3 C mean.
* Lower estimates - studies notably higher than the generally-accepted ranges (i.e. ECS 1.5-4.5 C) or 3 C mean.
* Estimates similar to generally-accepted range, including those that refute #1 or #2.

Climate models long term,"Hello all :)

I hope I'm on the right sub for this ask. I'm trying to write a novel set in the future. Let's say centuries, or even a thousand years or so. I'm trying to create a world where the climate is ""realist"" (the more I can of course as there are a lot of unknowns) but I don't know really where to start to learn about models or predicitions long term.

Most discussions and article I read about are about the end of the century not further. (which is logical as they're aimed towards today and how our actions impact us in the near future). But I'd like to dig deeper (and longer in time). 

I've some of the questions that I'd like answered ideally (but anything,really, about the future let's say past 2500 is interesting to me) :

 \- If we stop emiting most of our GHG, how long till we see a stabilisation of the climate ? 

 \- Could a stop of GHG can ""reverse"" the climate, centuries from now ? 

\- What are long term predictions about sea level rise ?

1980-2003 Natural variation in latent heat flux,"Much of modern warming occurred between ~1980 and ~2000, [HADCRUT](https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/temperature/HadCRUT4.png) puts warming at +0.5°C, and as I shall argue, the magnitude of temperature increase cannot be fully explained by either changes in solar output (1W/m2 output) nor increased CO2 (~1W/m2 surface).

Ocean **surface vaporization** and associated **latent heat flux** [\[1\]](http://earthguide.ucsd.edu/virtualmuseum/climatechange1/07_2.shtml) is the fundamental [driver](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/52009254_The_Role_of_Water_Vapor_Feedback_in_Unperturbed_Climate_Variability_and_Global_Warming) of natural climate variability (see [Clark](http://venturaphotonics.com/files/CoupledThermalReservoir_Part_I_E_EDraft.pdf) or [\[ch3.4\]](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/) for review of ocean thermodynamics):

- Latent heat flux is created as solar radiation heats ocean surfaces, causing vaporization. 
- Vaporization then cools ocean surfaces as ""latent heat"" and water vapor are transferred to the atmosphere.
- This process creates clouds and rain and upward air circulation and heats the atmosphere, and 
- the latent heat is transported by air currents to higher latitudes.

So latent heat flux transports solar radiation and water vapor from oceans to atmosphere and redistributes energy and water vapor. The amplitude of the latent heat flux process depends on the amount of solar radiation that reaches the ocean's surface, which again dependens on atmosphere albedo, clouds and aresols. Latent heat flux is fundamental in cloud formation and is proportional to surface wind speeds, both potential feedback loops. The effects on climate to a hypothetical change in latent heat flux is shown to be quite significant in [simulations](https://brian-rose.github.io/ClimateLaboratoryBook/courseware/water-water-everywhere.html).

Latent heat flux **increased 10% or about 9 W/m2** from 1980 to 2003 [\[fig\]](https://imgur.com/a/GqIe3q1) [\[paper\]](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/BAMS-88-4-527) [\[ch3:fig6\]](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/) and this is **attributed to ""natural variations"" in AR5** [\[ch3.4.2.2\]](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/) [\[paper\]](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/JCLI-D-11-00148.1). The magnitude of the increase excludes CO2-downwelling as the cause (ΔF = ~5.35×ln (373/338) = 0.52 W/m2 before feedbacks).

Changes in **ocean heat content** are significant as
- bulk of earth emissions imbalance (difference between earth incoming and outgoing radiation) goes to ocean heating, due to ocean's large mass and heat capacity [\[ch3:box 3.1\]](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/), and as
- continental warming due to human activity is believed to be [80-90%](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2012GL051106#grl29030-bib-0009) dominated by indirect warming from oceans. 

Since 2003 the derivative of ocean heat content and the derivative of the earth emissions imbalance both appear to be declining \[[Fig15](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331886058_Decadal_Changes_of_the_Reflected_Solar_Radiation_and_the_Earth_Energy_Imbalance)\], and this decline corresponds with the 2003 peak in latent heat flux. Ocean heat content, earth emissions imbalance and latent heat flux all indicate that the cause of the 1980-2003 anomaly has subsided.

**""Global brightening""** is one plausible theory for the heat flux anomaly, the shortwave (solar-)radiation reaching the surface appears to have increased significantly over the period [\[1983-2001\]](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=18825) due to changes in clouds or atmospheric aerosols.

**Since the period 1980-2003 has a 0.5-1 W/m2 expected increase in CO2-downwelling, and a 9 W/m2 measured increase in latent heat flux due to ""natural variation"", much of the warming in this period must also be due to natural variation. Logically, this could have occurred in one of two ways:** 
- **increases in temperature and latent heat flux have a common cause, such as ""global brightening"", or** 
- **latent heat flux increase, what ever its cause, caused the surface warming.**

*Edit: the significance of global brightening is underlined by the observation that the last half of the 20th century is believed to be the period of highest solar activity in the last 8000 years [[figure]](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Sunspot-number-reconstructed-from-the-concentration-of-the-cosmogenic-isotope-14-C-after_fig1_258806419)[[paper]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258806419_European_Solar_Physics_moving_from_SOHO_to_Solar_Orbiter_and_beyond)*",ezoy9q,22,0.87,4,1580974879.0

Climate sensitivity based on models vs ice core data,"Recent [estimations](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/07/climate-change-equilibrium-climate-sensitivity-global-warming/) of climate sensitivity imply that the steady state temperature increase from a doubling of C02 above pre-industrial levels (560 PPM) is between 2.6C and 4.1C.  This is a similar although narrower estimate than other mainstream estimates.

I came across this [paper](http://www.highstand.org/erohling/Rohling-papers/2009-Rohling%20et%20al%20AAtemp-sealevel%20ngeo557.pdf) which looks at the relationship between global C02 and temperature from antarctic ice core data.  This [figure](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Antarctic-temperature-and-global-sea-level-closely-Rohling-Grant/6dce13db600210d9e5c3fd2cd44f7714da867f59/figure/1) from the paper plots C02 vs Temperature, and draws a trend line which intersects with 387 ppm C02.  The Temperature of this intersection is 16C above anthropogenic levels.  This [paper](http://www.globalcoral.org/_oldgcra/AOSIS%20Briefing%202009.pdf#page=6) references the figure and re-affirms the implication, mentioning that it will take thousands of years to reach this steady state.  The original paper mentions that one explanation for the difference of models with lower estimates is that the trend line could curve upward (like the low, middle, and high lines in green) rather than be straight, but even if that were the case, it seems extremely unlikely that, based on the ice core data, a C02 level of 560 ppm would lead to anywhere near as low as 2.6-4.1C.

The most recent period with C02 levels near present day of \~400 ppm was the [mid-pliocene](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/52/13288), which had ""a mean annual surface temperatures approximately 1.8 °C to 3.6 °C warmer than preindustrial temperatures"".  How did 400 ppm yield a much lower temperature than implied by the [chart](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Antarctic-temperature-and-global-sea-level-closely-Rohling-Grant/6dce13db600210d9e5c3fd2cd44f7714da867f59/figure/1) of ice core data, especially considering the ice core chart has data points of 3-4C with C02 less than 300 ppm?  Even if the Mid-pliocene data gives a more accurate climate sensitivity, it seems it would be a much higher sensitivity than what present day mainstream modelers are suggesting, i.e. mid-pliocene implies 560 ppm would lead to higher temps than 2.6-4.1C.  

TLDR: Why is the climate sensitivity in mainstream models different (lower) than what geological ice core data suggests?",i22kyv,21,0.92,3,1596326436.0

Antarctic temperature anomaly/sea ice,"On http://earth.nullschool.net it's possible to view sea surface temperature data, and specifically sea surface temperature anomaly data.

I initially thought that it was cold freshwater floating on top of warmer melt-sustaining water, but when I look at the history I find that the negative temperature anomaly seems to persist basically year-round.

"Confusion over the climate change/global heating ""lag"".","To start off I simply want to say I'm not a denier or skeptic, I fully believe that anthropogenic climate change is causing more than 100% of the current global heating and that it will have severe consequences, but I am a layman who wants to learn more.  


I've been reading about climate change for a few months and gotten a deep interest in it. However, I am confused about how the radiative forcing and temperature growth lag functions. From what I understand; Radiative forcing grows first with temperature growth following behind. It takes time for temperature growth to catch up with forcing (decades, centuries, millenia depending on TCS or ECS?).  


However, I am also having a hitch on how this functions when it comes to things such as high GWP and other atmospheric gasses. For example, as methane is initially 120x more potent than CO2 but has a very short half-life, wouldn't this practically nullify the lag for this gas and add immediate warming? Wouldn't this mean that if there was a large release of 10 GtC, wouldn't that immediately a lot of warming?  


Or things like nitrous oxide, wouldn't that practically add an immediate temperature boost without any real lag? Is there a period where a greenhouse gas absorption hits a ""peak"" before it starts degrading?   


Thanks for any response, I'm curious and would love to learn more.",c725j1,19,0.92,7,1561829727.0

I'm attaching a link to an NOAA site which tracks global temperatures at thousands of locations.

Data covers the last 365 days. Summary format is the default with ability to drill down to detailed records.

Records are kept for both minimum and maximum temperatures and their is a clear trend in that the most common type of new record being set in the current environment is record high minimum temperatures.

The distribution of all-time records in the last 365 days is as follows:

High Min (231)

High Max (93)

Fiber arts and turning down the heat in houses,"I wonder of anyone made a good analysis on what a home made pair of socks, a warm sweater etc  (slow fashion if you like) from sustainable materials could do in terms of saving energy in private homes and in the workplace? I'm thinking a coomparison chart would help me but I'm not sure where to look for one. My partner is an engineer, with a core interest is advanced math, he can translate the things i don't understand if lots of calculations is involved.I ask because I weave, crochet and knit and there are ways of doing it with sustainable materials plus making our own garments makes it easy to make exactly what we need when we need it instead of buying lots of cheap garments on sale that eventually ends up in fabric dumps in remote deserts. Often clothes are made in factories far away that pollutes a lot and consumes lots of energy that could be saved for all the obvious reasons. I realize not every one can knit their own socks but plenty can. And with socks from the right type of materials, a sweater and a scarf we don't all need 24 degrees c or higher inside all the time.  We certainly don't in our family. It takes about two days to knit a pair of good socks for my youngest but only two minutes to buy a stack of cheap socks every time I loose one sock in the washer. I often wonder where the balance between pleasure and pain should be in thousands of situations like that.

I realize it doesn't save the world knitting a pair of socks as such. But I know I don't need the same amount of Putins gas as before I knitted them. A rainbow scarf I wove on a strong wooden loom  will outlive me probably, due to the strength of different types of animal fibers in the yarn I used for weaving it. Most scarves I've bought throughout my life are gone and long forgotten and was of poor quality or petroleum based fibers because it was convenient.

Sustainable fibers for yarn or fabrics are worth a discussion of its own, and diffictult, and I've adjusted what I buy a lot myself. But making the best  choice can be very difficult due to price and lack of knowledge and because legislation too often favors profit over anything else, even human life and the future of our existance on the planet, a lot of the time. And well, because we humans needs comfort to be okay.

So, any good analysis, articles, lectures, books etc on the subject?

It's no conspiracy or secret that GHG rose during these periods which that tied to the sun did increase global temps, but they did fall over time (though not as fast as they rose.)

Reading through this wikipedia page on the [Eemian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eemian) it says that temps were 1-2 degrees higher than during the Holocene. Assuming this is referring to pre-industrial levels, then does that mean that current warming (at the moment and if we can sustain it to 2 degrees) is on par with the Eemian?

So I'm seriously considering changing careers to more directly help combat climate change. I'm somewhat overwhelmed trying to research all the options though. I'd love some help figuring out where I might be most helpful. 

My background: I studied molecular biology at a well respected university, spent a year in academia, in devopmental neurobiology (early nervous system development). I then left and started a social enterprise working in preventative mental health that's doing rather well. It's far from a unicorn, so I'm not loaded, but I've got credible entrepreneur credentials now. I'm not committed to leaving, but it's at the point where I could easily leave and the company would be fine.

Through that, I gained a good understanding of the literature around human behaviour change, albeit from a health and well-being perspective. I'm quite good at public speaking and talking about science (I used to tutor), but not at all experienced in debating.

I'm considering a few paths: 

* Science communication/journalism
* Going back to school for a masters that will set me on a relevant academic path. Biotech seems like a good compromise between potential impact and potential for transferable skills, but I'm very open to other options. Including more policy/behaviour change focused work. 
* Looking for a job with a promising climate start up that could use my help

>In the early 1900s, a Serbian mathematician named Milutin Milankovitch meticulously calculated the amount of sunlight each latitude received in every phase of Earth’s orbital variations. His work culminated in the 1930 publication of Mathematical Climatology and the Astronomical Theory of Climate Change. He theorized that the ice ages occurred when orbital variations caused the Northern Hemisphere around the latitude of the Hudson Bay and northern Europe to receive less sunshine in the summer. 

>Short, cool summers failed to melt all of the winter’s snow. The snow would slowly accumulate from year to year, and its shiny, white surface would reflect more radiation back into space. Temperatures would drop even further, and eventually, an ice age would be in full swing. Based on the orbital variations, Milankovitch predicted that the ice ages would peak every 100,000 and 41,000 years, with additional “blips” every 19,000 to 23,000 years.",97wy49,18,0.92,26,1534459422.0

Climate sensitivity studies since the last IPCC report point towards a higher lower bound: Update and Further Discussion,"My post from a few months ago on climate sensitivity, ""Climate sensitivity studies since the last IPCC report point towards a higher lower bound""

[http://archive.is/Dy6iW](http://archive.is/Dy6iW)

has been updated to include an additional study:

**Accounting for changing temperature patterns increases historical estimates of climate sensitivity:** ([https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018GL078887](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018GL078887))

Andrews et al., 2018, GRL. Conclusion:

""**the pattern effect increases the long-term Otto et al. (2013) EffCS median and 5-95% confidence interval from 1.9K (0.9-5.0K) to 3.2K (1.5-8.1K).**""

This has been added to the section ""Similar to 1.5-4.5 C ECS consensus range with close to 3 C best estimate (TCR 1-2.5 C)""

The median value of 3.2 C is close the 3 C estimate. An argument can be made that the 5-95% confidence interval range is enough to move this to the ""higher estimates"" section, since the range is a higher confidence interval than the 17-83% 1.5-4.5 interval the IPCC quotes, rendering < 1.5 C less likely. The upper end also appears to extend past the 6 C the IPCC considers ""very unlikely"". The paper was co-authored by Forster and Gregory, 2 of the pioneers of the energy budget approach.

**To summarize, the preponderance of evidence since AR5 indicate:**

1. Large set of studies estimating ECS/TCR to be significantly higher accepted ~~media~~ median value of 3 C and / or range higher than the ""likely"" AR5 range of 1.5-4.5 C. For ECS, values from the studies include: 3.9 C, 5-5.3 C, 4 C (with 90% confidence interval extending only down to 2.3 C), 3.3-4.8 C, 3-6.3 C, and a study with lower bound of 3 C. One study shows TCR to be 2 C, which generally results in considerably higher ECS estimates.
2. Small set of studies estimating ECS/TCR to be significantly lower than the accepted median value/range. Most of those published in quality journals use similar energy budget models.
3. Set of studies consistent with the accepted median value/range. These include studies showing that simple methods from #2 inherently underestimate ECS/TCR

Notably, there's been less peer-reviewed critique of the studies in #1. Taken together, we can conservatively state the lower end of the 1.5-4.5 C sensitivity range is less likely, warranting an increase in the lower bound, similar to the recent Royal Society report on the topic [`https://royalsociety.org/~/media/policy/Publications/2017/27-11-2017-Climate-change-updates-report.pdf`](https://royalsociety.org/~/media/policy/Publications/2017/27-11-2017-Climate-change-updates-report.pdf). Both of our analyses are arguably conservative assessments, given the set of newer studies indicating higher values. Thoughts?

A recent dubious claim was made elsewhere, asserting:

>Claim:""The climate appears to be less sensitive to changes in CO2 than previously believed. That's a very good thing. There are still lots of different estimates, but the fact that the divergence between energy balance models and general circulation models is widely acknowledged among climate scientists, and has been for five years now, tells us that warming won't be as bad as previously feared.""

[http://archive.is/haQxS](http://archive.is/haQxS)

I've seen various forms of this in certain political realms but it's contradicted by the preponderance of evidence. When pressed, the user (WP) selectively cited 3 papers, 2 of which I cite (one, Otto et al. was included in AR5 and thus was not cited), and one of which placed the median value close to 3 C with a narrowed range on both ends.

Another user responded and cited my previous post on the subject, to which WP responed (and thus my interest in responding) with some spurious critiques. I think it's worth examining them to understand some of the debate tactics used, and observe how self-described ""climate skeptics"" or ""lukewarmists"" rationalize.

First problem with the critique - It skips over the sizable list of high-end ECS/TCR estimates (see #1 above). On a related note, had I taken WP's approach, I'd have just cited some of these high-end estimates, ignored the rest, then asserted with confidence that climate sensitivity appears to be higher than previously thought - very bad news. Or perhaps I'd start with the conclusion and only selective cite a few studies when pressed. A thorough analysis of the evidence, however, renders the conclusion more nuanced.

Second spurious critique - Complaint over journal filtering criteria:

>WP:""Did you notice how many papers they discounted? From the authors ""Criteria"" section, ""I'm mainly sticking to higher Impact Factor journals."" So he's purposefully leaving out journals that tend to publish energy balance model papers""

The user did not support this with any evidence. The criteria of using a filter that leaves out obscure journals has nothing to do with energy budget models. In fact, my observations are that most energy budget model papers are published in better quality journals. Otto et al. (Nature Geoscience), Lewis and Curry (2015, Climate Dynamics), Marvel et al. (GRL), Andrews et al. (2018, GRL), and older studies such as Forster and Gregory (2006, Journal of Climate), among many, are all published in higher quality journals, so that is a strange argument.

Third spurious critique - Median ECS/TCR values that don't very precisely match 3 C and 1.8 C respectively should not be categorized as ""consistent with AR5 and the typical median around 3 C and 1.5-4.5 likely range.""

This is an odd line of argument, since the user's argument claiming ""very good news"" implies a much more significant shift than the \~5-10% deviations in each direction shown in this section. Details:

One study's conclusion on ECS: "" are well described by the currently accepted range of an increase of 1.5 K to 4.5 K per doubling of CO2.""

>WP:""Doesn't name a best estimate for ECS. Uses the expanded AR5 range, which was reduced from the AR4 range.""

Red herring argument. Our scope is not to determine how estimates have changed since AR4, but how estimates of climate sensitivity have moved since AR5, either median or range. That the paper uses the AR5 range (1.5-4.5) indicates that it's consistent with AR5, and thus appears in this section. Had the lower bound been raised substantially it may be a candidate for being included in the higher estimates section.

Study:""Inhomogeneous forcing and transient climate sensitivity Shindell, 2014, Nature Climate Change ""the lowest end of the range of transient climate response to CO2 in present models and assessments (<1.3 °C) is very unlikely."" Press Release""

>WP: ""That's a bottom boundary and is well below the TCR of 1.8°C in AR5.""

1.8 C TCR is the median in AR5. By definition, a bottom boundary is going to be lower than that. Recall that Lewis and Curry placed their median TCR value at 1.3 C. Shindell renders that unlikely.

>WP:""Doesn't name ECS. Revised upwards from what value?""

The study does estimate ECS. Marvel et al.: ""accounting for differences in equilibrium forcing efficacy revises the estimate upwards; our new best estimate(using efficacies derived from the iRF) is 2.6 C (Fig. 2a). If efficacies are instead calculated from the ERF, the b est estimate of ECS is 3.0 C (Fig. 2b).""

The value of Otto et al. was 1.9. 3 C is more than a 50% increase from 1.9 C.

Study:""We find that including observations over the hiatus reduces the most likely value for ECS from 2.8 °C to 2.5 °C, but that the lower bound of the 90% range remains stable around 2 °C.""

>WP:""ECS is stated outright to be less than 3.0°C. This should have been filed under the ""less than""

While the median is somewhat lower, the lower bound of the 90% range in that study is raised to 2 C, higher than the best estimate of the small set of simple energy budget models WP prefers. Recall that the IPCC 66% range has a lower bound of 1.5 C. This study is a higher lower bound with higher confidence. So we'd have at least as good of an argument for including this in the higher range section, since 1.5 C was the previous lower bound of an less certain ""likely"" range (66%) in AR5. By ignoring that critical piece (after considering the range to be important above), WP's argument is weak.

Study: ""produces a current best estimate of equilibrium climate sensitivity of 2.9 C (1.7–7.1?°C, 90% confidence). ""

>WP:""Also less than 3.0°C, though very close.""

Oh my this is getting silly. 3 -> 2.9 = about a 3% less median (very good news?), yet note the even higher lower/upper bounds of 1.7-7.1 C compared with 1.5-4.5 C.

Study: ""Here we present a new emergent constraint on ECS that yields a central estimate of 2.8 degrees Celsius with 66 per cent confidence limits (equivalent to the IPCC ‘likely’ range) of 2.2–3.4 degrees Celsius.""

>WP:""Less than 3.0°C for sure, but note that this is for GCMs in particular! This means that it's not a reduction of 0.2°C, but a reduction of 0.6°C! ""

The categorization is in regards to the general best estimate 3 C value and 1.5-4.5 range, not with the methodology used to derive it. Had one taken this approach, many of the studies in this section would have been included in the first section. We've consistently seen major upward revisions with regards to energy budget models that WP relies on to make his case. Such a categorization, however, would not be consistent with the scope.

Study: ""best estimate for TCR of 1.66 °C, with a 5–95% range of 1.0–3.3 C, consistent with the climate models considered in the IPCC 5th Assessment Report.""

>WP:""Though they like to say ""consistent with,"" 1.66°C is lower than AR5's 1.8°C for TCR. This, too, was misfiled. It should have been under than ""less than"" category.""

Note again that the upper end of the range is increased from AR5, so we'd have a similarly weak argument for including it in the high estimates section. Details:

AR5 on TCR:""The grey shaded range marks the likely 1 C to 2.5 C range, and the grey solid line marks the extremely unlikely greater than 3 C""

Study:""with a 5–95% range of 1.0–3.3 C, consistent with the climate models considered in the IPCC 5th Assessment Report.""

Neither the 0.3 C increase at the upper end of the range nor the 0.14 C reduction in the median is particularly significant, both within 10%. Thus the reason the study itself states the values are consistent with AR5.

Getting back to the new study added (Andrews et al. 2018), the ECS median here is higher than 3 C (3.2 C), although within 10%. Using very precise criteria, their 3.2 C is inconsistent with AR5 and should be put in the first section of higher estimates. The range arguably might warrant that, but not the median.",95qqq4,18,0.96,7,1533767175.0

With coal power plants on the way out and marine fuels due to have sulfur content cut by 85% it is reasonable to expect that sulfates will have a diminished role in offsetting global warming.  I am finding few sources that attempt to quantify just how many degrees C of additional warming is currently being prevented thanks to sulfates.  

> In 1991, the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines ejected more than 20 million tons of sulfur dioxide— ... Climatologists predicted global temperatures would drop as a result of that global sulfate infusion. They were right: Following the eruption, global temperatures abruptly dipped by about a half-degree (0.6°C) for about two years.

In 2005 human activity released [115,000 gigagrams](http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/collection/haso2) of SO2 or 127 million tons.  The implication is that anthropomorphic sulfate emissions equals six continually erupting Mt Pinatubos.  On a strictly linear basis that would imply several degrees C of warming is being avoided.   Without replacing sulfates we risk accelerated global warming in a theoretical scenario where humanity stops burning fossil fuels.

I'd like to know what's wrong with this very fundamental analysis and where one can learn more about the implications of sulfate loss in the atmosphere.

"Is a stable climatic state with a Northeastern Asia with far warmer, wetter winters possible? More generally, is climate almost fully geographically/orbitally determined, or is it possible for alternate stable climate states to exist?","I've been developing, on and off for the past nearly 10 years in some form\*, a speculative evolution and alternate history scenario based on this main premise:

**What if the Siberian Anticyclone was a far weaker/less permanent phenomenon, leading to the climate of Northeastern Asia being significantly warmer and wetter in winter†, i.e. generally more North American?**

The problem is, the geography and Milanković characteristics of the Earth are supposed to be nearly identical to that IRL. Indeed, significantly changing it would defeat the point of the timeline—it features an alternate *Asia*, not a continent that somewhat resembles Asia—and would be largely impossible given the Point of Divergence of at earliest 880 kya.

Also, while I know that it *may* be possible for mass-extinction-level events to create new climatic equilibria, there also isn't a mass extinction in the scenario. So... ***is this even possible?***

I can see 2 possibilities:

1. Geography, orbital, and broad atmospheric characteristics almost always overpower and dampen even the most exceptional (sub-mass-extinctional) ""initial weather state"" conditions. This would be good because it would indicate that the climates of my patently fictional worlds (along with alternate geographies) would be able to be strictly and accurately predicted, but would effectively kill the aforementioned project.
2. An exceptional but sub-mass-extinctional ""initial weather state"" (i.e. pressure and wind patterns, temperatures, ground albedo, momentary atmospheric concentrations) can result in the transition to a new stable climate state, despite geography and orbital characteristics remaining the same. This would have nearly the opposite effect—while supporting the project mentioned, it would make determining the climates of my patently fictional worlds (along with alternate geographies) much more difficult.

**Which is true, for this situation and more generally?**

\*Well, it was a proposal for a future climate geoengineering project from 2012–7, more of an alternate history from 2017–9, and more speculative evolution from 2019–.

†Exceptional greenhouse gas-induced global warming (as is forecast for the future without radical economic shifts) would result in significantly warmer winters, *but also significantly hotter summers,* contrary to the objective of the timeline, and such global warming is likely to be, well, mass-extinctional.",tj65rd,16,0.88,1,1647848012.0

Can Mindy strengthen Larry? Change its course?,"I've been looking at the NWS hurricane map and it looks like Mindy will arrive in the same area as Larry at approximately the same time, somewhat to the southwest of it.

I've also looked that sea surface temperature anomaly maps for today, and the waters over which Mindy will pass are relatively warmer than the water in the Gulf is. That is to say, somewhere around \~28C/82F. Which is to say, Mindy could possibly strengthen again. The forecast is for it to be a tropical depression by the time it reaches Larry's track.

 Whether it does or not, does anyone have any idea how the two storms will interact? I don't know enough to have a valid guess.

Greenhouse warming mechanism,"
Am I correct in thinking that the primary greenhouse warming mechanism is:
- infrared photon emitted by the earth's surface strikes a CO2 molecule
- the molecule becomes more energetic and transfers it's energy to surrounding molecules via collisions 

And the secondary mechanism is:
- infrared photon emitted by the earth's surface strikes a CO2 molecule
- after some time that molecule may emit an infrared photon as a result.  
- if the direction of emission is downwards then the photon will either strike another CO2 molecule, or strike the earth's surface, warming it.

Because the majority of layman's information sources only mention the second mechanism.

Abrupt Climate Change (and my ultimate weltschmertz),"Hello Everyone.

My growing interest in studying climate science has led me across thoroughly bleak analyses and predictions towards our mutual future (e.g Guy Mcpherson's work). He's been described (in an article critical of his work) as a photo-negative of the climate-denier sphere, citing numerous feedback loops that may lead us away from linear energy budget growth models and towards exponential ones.

One example of such a feedback loop - As temperatures rise in the boreal forest, reduced permafrost coverage also reduces the refractive index of the ground, leading to higher heat absorption, which feeds back into reduced coverage.

Another topic I was made aware of is that of global dimming, which implies that reducing the amount of pollutants in our atmosphere would (at this point) lead to an increase in the total irradiance, tilting the energy budget further.

Setting those examples (of which there are many more) aside, I am as alarmed by these issues as I am appalled by the conclusions they draw - that modern human society can (and, according to Mcpherson, already has) lead to abrupt and irreversible changes in our climate patterns that would leave this planet uninhabitable (at the very least, for us). Up until that point, I was mostly aware of the linear, reversible trends our actions induce.

So, after all this morose rambling, I wanted to ask you fellow scientists:

* Can you point me to studies and projective models that take feedback mechanisms into account, set a lower/upper limit on their impact, and modify the trends accordingly? I was unable to do so myself.

* (optional) Provide any counterpoints which would offset the overwhelming pessimism I'm currently experiencing? Personally, I'm trying my best to adjust my lifestyle (stopped eating meat, driving, flying when possible) and affect other people's opinions (to extremely limited success) but at this point in my life (having just turned 30) I'm not even sure what future I should plan for (e.g should I be having kids?? I'm not really expecting an answer on that...)",6qnd7y,14,1.0,10,1501493953.0

So what is the actual solution?,"I'm not going to pretend that I know or understand any of the science when it comes to climate studies. I've read climate change articles for and against, and I'm just as clueless as when I started.

So what is the actual solution? If one had absolute power over people, what is going to pause/reverse climate change? Is it even possible?  Is it even necessary?  Do we just stop all industry?  Pull all cars off the road?  Or is it just change our light bulbs to LEDs and throw some solar panels on the roof, opting to one day pollute the ground rather than the air?

I look at the people in my neighbourhood and they love to drop ""climate change, am I right?"" any time there's a warm day, yet they leave they're high wattage lights on all night, big screen tvs on all night, computers running 24hrs a day, drive 30 miles to work daily, cut they're lawns with gas mowers, and drive their kids to soccer practice every night...

I don't do it everyday, but I walk to the office quite a bit (I bring my dog so it's a way of killing two birds with one stone).  I have a battery powered lawn mower and lawn tools, I would put solar panels up if it wasn't so cost prohibitive (that's mostly for independence though), I have only LED lights (well maybe 1 or cfls still in the lamps), my computers automatically turn themselves off at night, my outdoor lights are on wemos, and an electric car would be cool. However, I'm not going to give up my a/c, or natural gas bbq and heating, i like taking my kids to their practices and not having to car pool, and I like watching my 4-5 tv shows a week after my kids go to bed. So if the solution is turning off the lights on earth, it's not going to happen, I don't think. 

What is the actual paradigm shift that's required here? u/counters; you seem to know the science well, I'd appreciate your opinion.

Can clear-sky measurements of CO2 radiative forcing be used to calibrate radiative forcing models?,"*Can anyone here knowledgeable in climate science chime in and provide any feedback on why ""clear-sky"" studies like this can or can't be used in the manner described below? Any help much appreciated.*

The CO2 radiative forcing term is often modelled as

*Δ F=k ln(c/c0),*

where *k* in AR3 is *5.35* (page 358 in the ""WG1 physical basis"")*.*

Now in a 2015 Nature article by Feldmann *""Observational determination of surface radiative forcing by CO2 from 2000 to 2010""*, the radiative effect of CO2 was [observed](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14240) to be **0.2** **W/m2** over the decade for 2000-2010(see [Figure 4](https://imgur.com/a/OErknh0)), during which CO2 increased from 370ppm to 392 ppm.

This is 30% lower than what the IPCC model states:

*Δ F=5.35\* ln(392/370) =* ***0.309 W/m2.***

To approximate the result of the Nature article, the parameter  *k* should have been reduced to *\~3.6:*

*Δ F=3.6\* ln(392/370) =* ***0.207 W/m2***.

**Feldmann and co-authors appear to not have noticed or commented that the radiative forcing they found was low in their paper.**

ECS can be [split](https://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/clip_image0022.jpg) into *pre-feedback climate sensitivity* and a *post-feedback gain factor,* and the radiative forcing of CO2 is a factor in pre-climate sensitivity.

**Thus a reduced radiative forcing estimate by 30% would mean that ECS estimates from IPCC models should be reduced by 30% as well.**

[This](https://www.essoar.org/doi/10.1002/essoar.10501106.2) recently submitted paper also seems to support the idea that estimate of CO2 radiative forcing used by IPCC should be reduced.",es9b2t,13,1.0,1,1579682868.0

Now - looking at the climate change which is cascading through our weather systems - there's a chance we would lose the jet stream - right?  It could stall or move further south.

Buuuut.  With average temps rising quickly - will we notice the loss of the jet stream as our average temps will increase anyway?  (maybe accompanied by more wild storms mind you)

A recent paper in Nature ([https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-019-0505-x](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-019-0505-x)) indicates that current state of the art climate models may need to be updated. Quote: "" The failure of state-of-the-art models to capture the correct response introduces critical error into their projections of climate change in the many regions sensitive to tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures."" I'm wondering to what extent current models may indeed need to be updated and to what extent the updated models are likely to predict relatively less mean global warming by 2100? The last sentence suggests ""continuing La Nina-like trends"" which might imply somewhat lower warming though still extreme weather volatility (more droughts in one region, more rainfall in another)? Quote: ""However, the strength of the tropical Pacific influence on global climate implies that past and future trends will diverge from those simulated by coupled climate models that, due to their cold tongue bias, misrepresent the response of the tropical Pacific to rising CO2. Until state-of-the-art models more faithfully represent the observed tropical Pacific, climate impact assessments should consider the consequences for the global hydroclimate of continuing La Niña-like trends in tropical Pacific SSTs""

What effects can lakes have on precipitation?,"I'm pretty interested in alternate history and specifically I've thought a lot about alternate nations in the western United States. Said area is very dry and is currently undergoing a drought, so I've thought of some alternate lakes that could exist in the area. But I'm not sure if they would actually have the precipitation effect I think they may have.

The two lakes are as follows:

1. Lake Cahuilla, which is effectively just the entire Salton Sink filled up. This lake existed not all that long ago but doesn't anymore. It's area would be around 5,700 sq km and it's in a very dry and high evaporation area.
2. Lake Idaho. This is an ancient lake that existed in the north-west area of the snake river valley in Idaho. It was around the size of lake Ontario. 

So the big question that I have is this. What would these lakes, if they existed today, possibly do to wetten the western U.S.A, both in their immediate area aswell as longer range effects. Could areas like the (un-submerged) snake river plain and other areas of Idaho be made lush by the massive lake? And would the surrounding mountains around the salton sink, and thus the water issue in the Colorado, by improved by the existence of lake Cahuilla.

Question on the Basics of Atmospheric General Circulation Models,"First, some background. About 10 years ago I took a physical geography class at UC Berkeley about climate systems. We learned a lot of the basic things like Earth's energy budget and atmospheric circulation (Hadley, Ferrel, and Polar Cells, ENSO, Coriolis effect, etc.). Since my study major was actually Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and not geography, for the final project of this class the professor allowed me to make a very basic energy balance model written in JavaScript (so it would run in a web browser). At the time, dealing with the physics of fluid circulation seemed too difficult and out of scope so I didn't even attempt it. This model was very basic in that it modeled the surface of the earth as a 2-dimensional grid with a resolution of only a few degrees of longitude and latitude. Each grid cell was designated as either ""land"" or ""ocean"" which were given different values for albedo and specific heat capacity. Each grid cell had a unit vector normal to the surface which was modeled as being flat. There was a global unit vector which pointed in the direction of the sun and would rotate around the earth's rotation axis once every simulated day. The time step was 30 minutes. Using the solar constant, the model would calculate the amount of radiation absorbed and reflected by a surface cell given its position and this heat would be transported across the surface at different rates depending on whether the cell was land or ocean and calculate a new temperature for that location. There were a few other parameters which controlled the rate of radiation emitted back into space. Over time, a balance would be reached where the average global temperature would fluctuate around a stable value with the day/night cycle.

Anyway, I now have the of time to study how to make a very basic atmospheric circulation model. I don't need or expect it to be an accurate model of the earth. At the moment, I am not interested in modeling ocean circulation or even the humidity. I am only interested in modeling a uniform spherical surface with dry air as the fluid. This sphere will be heated by radiation which comes from a direction that rotates around the sphere as in the energy balance model described above. The major difference is that now I want to model the fluid dynamics on the surface of this rotating sphere. I have a pretty good understanding of the forces that act on moving fluids on a rotating body like the Coriolis effect, pressure gradient force, gravitational force, etc., and I'm confident that I can program anything once I understand it, but, in attempting to read up on how an atmospheric general circulation model works, I am running into issues with my understanding.

I quickly found out that atmospheric circulation models *do not use height (z)* as the vertical coordinate. Instead they tend to use pressure coordinates. This is useful because pressure decreases monotonically with elevation so that given a surface pressure and temperature gradient with pressure we can calculate the height in meters above the surface. This is why weather maps for winds at different ""heights"" use millibar (or hectopascal) heights. From what I have read, the great thing about using pressure as a vertical coordinate is that it's easier to write a model which assumes hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical direction, i.e., the pressure gradient and gravitational forces are balanced (I understand that this isn't exactly *correct* but is a good assumption to make at *synoptic* scale). Using pressure coordinates also allows us to model horizontal flow using a *geostrophic approximation*. So ""horizontal"" is actually horizontal with respect to a constant pressure surface.

That brings me to the part that I do not understand. If the model assumes hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical direction, how can there ever be any vertical motion? Can there be a net acceleration in the vertical direction under the assumption that the pressure gradient force is in balance with the gravitational force? **edit**: To attempt to answer my own question, I think the explanation is that by using pressure as the vertical coordinate we sacrifice knowing or caring about vertical positional velocity in *meters per second* to instead only consider pressure velocity in *pascals per second.* Is this the correct way to understand it?

And if every direction in the horizontal has the same pressure, how can there be any net acceleration in the horizontal direction? There would be no pressure gradient in the horizontal direction!

I must be fundamentally misunderstanding something about how these models work. Can someone please help me to understand? Thank you.

From looking at the Wikipedia article on [Primitive Equations - Presssure Coordinates in Vertical, Cartesian Tangential plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_equations#Pressure_coordinate_in_vertical,_Cartesian_tangential_plane), It looks like horizontal acceleration is also supposed to depend on changes in *Geopotential* with respect to changes in horizontal position along a constant-pressure surface. So maybe I need a better understanding of how geopotential relates to pressure and temperature.

This raises another question though, which is how do I keep track of where the sphere's surface is on a vertical pressure scale? If the pressure at the surface changes (though is generally somewhere around 100,000 Pa) does that mean I need to keep track of ""where"" the surface is along the vertical scale for a column of air too? If so, how? **edit**: To attempt to answer my own question again, I think this also has to do with the concept of *Geopotential* which should be zero at the surface of the sphere. I haven't been able to find any equation for the Geopotential as a function of pressure and temperature, but there is an equation for the *partial derivative* of Geopotential as a function of pressure and temperature.

What does it mean that methane (and other ghg) loses effectiveness as a greenhouse gas over time?,"From my understanding, methane degrades into co2 over time. At the same time, we say that its global warming potential decreases a lot over the decades. 

Is that because of the degradation, i.e. the ch4 itself stays at a gwp of 84 or so and its loss of gwp is because of its concentration in the atmosphere decreasing?

And if so, why can we not simply assign methane a gwp and then look at the concentration of it in the atmosphere?

Complete newbie looking to learn more - Really appreciate any insights.,"Sorry for jumping in - I couldn't find an FAQ or newbie type of thread. Ever since I heard Greta's speech (I know she gets a lot of crap online, but it greatly impacted me and helped me start to realize the scope of the problem) I have been in a complete panic for weeks. I am only 25 and it really got me thinking about the future, whether I want a child, or if its even worth it to plan for retirement. I am absolutely horrified about what IPCC will say in 2021. I've even read that new CMIP6 models are running even hotter than before. To add a bit of hyperbole, this post can be reduced to: *do we need to start preparing for a collapse of society or even extinction within the next 50 years?*

As a result of my panic, I posted a few days ago to r/ climatechange and, I think, I got a lot of very good information. However, I also read a few threads on this subreddit stating the r/ climatechange's mod team is more align to being climate skeptics. I would like to see if you folks have a different opinion on the following.

\- It doesn't seem like society is going to collapse by 2050 due to climate change. At least IPCC and other sources don't seem to think so.  Do you know of any reputable scientists that think collapse is a likely outcome. I've read a few articles and posts that state scientists haven't said anything because of reputation risks - do you think that is likely?

\- I've gotten a few links disproving the 'clathrate gun' theory. While they seem reputable and source peer reviewed articles ( [https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable\_progress.htm](https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable_progress.htm)) I also saw various referenced to a study by Shakhova that corroborates the theory. Forgive me, I don't have a background in science and a lot of the peer reviewed papers are too technical for my understanding. Also this recent tweet about a spike in methane:  [https://twitter.com/rgatess/status/1172898980415434758](https://twitter.com/rgatess/status/1172898980415434758) 

\- The chart and forecasts from IPCC (and here: [https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/](https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/) ) appear to suggest an increase of 3 - 4 C by 2100. But it also shows that we hit 2C by 2040-2050 (under current policies). What does this mean for humanity? I know no one can answer this questions accurately - but right now I don't know what to think.

\- Could someone ELI5 the whole Carbon budget? According to IPCC Special report we have \~420 gtco2 before we hit \~1.5c, which is about 10 years of current emissions. However, the budget was greatly expanded from IPCC 2016 estimate. Could someone help me understand why?

\- I understand that RCP8.5 is not an expected pathway (we would need to continue burning more and more fossil fuels until 2100).( [https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-the-high-emissions-rcp8-5-global-warming-scenario](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-the-high-emissions-rcp8-5-global-warming-scenario)) Would you concur?

\- Also, I know its long but anyone could help me understand how trustworthy Robert Walker is ([https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable\_progress.htm](https://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable_progress.htm)) I would greatly appreciate it. It seems that the article has great scientific sources - but I just want to make sure I am getting the best and most accurate picture possible.

Baby steps for on climate action?,"I meet many people are concerned about climate change, but do nothing because they feel like there's little they can do. 

Buying carbon credits isn't as tangible as feeding the hungry, or cleaning litter from a park -and many suggestions for reducing carbon imprint require a change of lifestyle or serious expenditure. However, 57% of u.s. residents have less than $500 for an emergency expense - and let's face it, change is not something people embrace easily. 

So here are my questions:

If you have $500 (or less) to spend, how could you spend it to have the most impact on climate change?

Comparing current GHG concentrations / forcing to RCPs,"Does anyone know how to make an apples to apples comparison of ""how far along"" we are in terms of the RCPs? Is the current GHG concentration ""ahead"" or ""behind"" schedule compared to say RCP8.5, and by how much?

The reason I ask is that I'm a climate scientist specializing in local impacts for adaptation and risk assessment, and the folks who use our projections are increasingly asking about where RCP8.5 fits in terms of emissions reduction strategies and where we are at so far. I've generally viewed this question as a red herring but it's just coming up too much to not answer any more.

If you look at the values in Table 2 of [https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/aggi/aggi.html](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/aggi/aggi.html) for Total Radiative Forcing they are larger than the historical numbers at [http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web-apps/tnt/RcpDb/dsd?Action=htmlpage&page=compare](http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web-apps/tnt/RcpDb/dsd?Action=htmlpage&page=compare) by about 50% in 1980.

Of course these aren't directly comparable as the NOAA paper is just converting concentrations with constants and ignoring feedbacks. So I suspect the main difference is water vapour feedback perhaps? The RCP database notes that total concentration exludes mineral dust and the effect of land albedo, however.

The difference between the two measures of total radiative forcing decreases with time and if you extrapolate from the 4 points of overlap it would be about 32% today. Applying this ratio seems to suggest that we are doing (a little bit) better in 2018 than RCP8.5 forcing by 2020 was projected to be. Does this sound about right? I had it in my head that we'd been emitting worse than RCP8.5 for quite some time now but maybe that was a few years ago and we've actually started turning away from this pathway a bit?

After reading a reddit post on r/all about CO2 levels reaching an all time high, I started to investigate more into the issue myself (all of the top comments were saying ""we're fucked"" and ""it's too late).  I did more research into American *news* articles and a lot of them somewhat confirmed what they were saying (if we don't have a global, coordinated push we could see the collapse of society within 5 to 30 years).

I stumbled upon this site after someone posted it as a source to validate their point and the information presented in it contradicts what I've said on subs like r/science, r/worldnews, r/politics, etc.  (I'm asking this sub because the majority of commenters here seem to actually study climate).

Does this site present a reasonable/fair explanation of climate change?  I don't want to cherry-pick and believe information just because it aligns with what I want to hear (climate change is probably the biggest issue humanity is facing at the moment, but a lot of the potential effects depicted in the media are intended to ""scare"" people to act).


**TLDR**:
I suppose a good question to end with would be ""Would this be a good source to give to someone to read who is terrified about the effects of climate change?""",c8x0uk,11,1.0,11,1562207228.0
"Why did the global temperature go down by 5 degrees celcius 146M years ago when co2 went up by 50% at the same time, shouldn’t the temperature go up when CO2 goes up a lot? What factors prevented this?","I saw this graphic and was wondering why CO2 often correlates inversely with temperature.

Does anyone know because of which factors 

1. Temperature went up by 8 degrees Celcius 600M years ago while co2 went down by 30%
2. Temperature went down by 8 degrees celcius while Co2 went up slighly 439M years ago
3. Temperature went up by 8 degrees while co2 didn’t move 270M years ago
4. Temperature went down by 3 degrees celcius while co2 went up by 30% 146M years ago
5. After that, temperature stayed stable for 120M years while CO2 went down

I get that CO2 traps heat, but why doesn’t it seem to correlate with temperature? Co2 only correlates with temperature once 300M years ago and 5 times it didn’t. How so? 

Referring to this graphic.

Thanks a lot!

Edit:

Ok I found the answer, the graphic posted is faked by putting the co2 graph 100 million years later in order to make it look like the effect is inverse.

His claim is that the  Russian model ""isn't parameterized to fudge the numbers"" like the other models.

Is weather forecasting dropping behind in it's ability to forecast as the climate heats up and weather patterns speed up?,"My understanding is weather forecasting requires large amounts of data and large supercomputers to run the simulations.

Which is fine in a stable climate system as weather patterns will have seasonal rates and models that mimic those patterns and rates will be able to simulate quite accurately what is going on.

With an warming climate the weather patterns have more energy to be more chaotic and dynamic meaning you will need an order of magnitude improvement in data capture, simulation model detail/accuracy and supercomputing power.  All of which costs more money.

Climate Wars - A New Hope (for deniers),"I noted a [recent paper](https://t.co/D94a9YYCC0) pushed by not so competent but very denier-friendly Judith Curry with the hope of justifying some of her positions. I will briefly comment on it with the observation that it also shows a worrying decrease in quality in the AGU publications.

> Abstract

> A global 1/4∘ ocean/sea-ice 50-member ensemble simulation is used to disentangle the low-frequency imprints of the atmospherically-forced oceanic variability and of the chaotic intrinsic oceanic variability (IOV) on the large-scale (10° x10° ) ocean heat content (OHC) between 1980 and 2010. The IOV explains most of the interannual-to-decadal large-scale OHC variance over substantial fractions of the global ocean area that increase with depth: 9%, 22%, and 31% in the 0-700m, 700-2000m and 2000m-bottom layers, respectively. Such areas concern principally eddy-active regions, mostly found in the Southern Ocean and in western boundary current extensions, but also concern the subtropical gyres at intermediate and deep levels. The oceanic chaos may also induce random multidecadal fluctuations so that large-scale regional OHC trends computed on the 1980-2010 period cannot be unambiguously attributed to the atmospheric forcing in several oceanic basins at various depths. These results are likely to raise detection and attribution issues from real observations.

The first problem is with the attribution claim from the abstract, where from a basic statistical analysis of the variance of a signal (which is also misleadingly extrapolated) the authors somehow try to reach major attribution claims. Such a statistical analysis if done perfectly can at most estimate the statistical significance of the trend but to reach conclusions on attribution the laws of physics must be involved. But rest assured the analysis is nowhere near perfect, is in fact borderline junk.

First of all a perfect analysis would be done not blindly on the output of a model ensemble but instead on something strongly linked to the actual measurements since if the two are different you are at most reaching conclusions about the model rather than the actual system. And in this case the ensemble run is a very bad one which seems to be very poorly initialized and run to the point where the total OHC change over the entire interval is somewhere similar to measured values but for instance the global OHC change in the 700-2000m region is not only outside of any decent range on uncertainty in the existing measurements but actually of opposite sign. You would think that a paper that can't model the sign of global OHC change in a major region of the ocean would be more careful about jumping to conclusions but that is not the case here.

But that is not the biggest problem with the paper, there are two other much bigger problems, one that goes to a very dubious and misleading extrapolation and one that completely invalidates the entire study and raises questions if the authors really understand the system that they were trying to model.

The extrapolation problem is simple but is worrying from the scientific integrity point of view, the authors find a certain variance in the short and medium-term signal which they (incorrectly, we'll see why later) link to something they call chaotic intrinsic oceanic variability (IOV) with some numbers (which also do not represent ""most"" of it as they claim). From there in the abstract they jump to ""the oceanic chaos may also induce random multidecadal fluctuations"" (with no numbers given, you will see why), which however is the complete opposite of what their analysis finds, in fact in the body of the paper they find in the long-term analysis ""These globally-integrated OHC trends are barely affected by the oceanic chaos as the PDF spreads are marginal in each of the layers."" So even their own numbers debunk the grandiose assertion made in the abstract.

But that is still not the biggest problem with the paper, the biggest problem is how they estimate the variability of the OHC output and from there the IOV - they basically subtract from the modeled value the linear trend over entire interval which they consider ""an estimator of regional OHC trends induced by the atmospheric forcing"" and whatever is left in their opinion must be an ""estimator of the uncertainty induced by the oceanic chaos"". On physical level this is so naive that you must wonder if the authors have graduated from Trump University, they basically assume that the atmospheric forcing was something resulting in a linear trend when in fact on their own detrended graphs you can still point to the Pinatubo effects on the top 700m and the recovery after it, which completely dominates the variance on the medium intervals. Which of course they misrepresent as being IOV.

So a dubious and misleading extrapolation over a huge mistake resulting in yet another paper to be used by incompetent deniers. I still can't understand how this passed peer-review.",6anz9v,12,1.0,2,1494547414.0

Science Funding,"Although there are examples of research that may not seem relevant now, or research dollars spent in ways that seem misguided or misused, this is not the majority of funded science. And even good research can be misinterpreted by the media or individuals who do not understand its broader applications. For scientists to receive research grants, they have to convince their peers, who also happen to be their competitors, that their ideas are worth funding. Thus, for me to recommend a grant for someone else takes potential money from me, so, the system encourages thorough critique of one another, and careful monitoring by employees at government agencies that oversee the funds. Then, if funding is granted, the scientists receiving money has to submit annual (sometimes quarterly) reports on progress and then provide a final write up that is publicly available along with all data generated. If the money is not spent appropriately, or, if the researchers are not productive, they are no longer eligible for funding again. Imagine if all government worked that way. Competition by the best for limited money, and, if money is not used correctly, that person or business will not get funds again. I don't think the average person understands how difficult it is to get funding for research, the high level of accountability that accompanies funding, the economic benefits that come from scientific discovery, the training of the next generation of scientists/engineers/inventors who keep America on top, and the number of jobs provided by research.",5qi6hs,11,0.93,3,1485535937.0
Climate Change Evidence and Counter Arguments Assistance Needed,"Hello,

Does anyone have information that backs this? I have googled for it, and only found unreliable 'news' articles saying these items with no real sources.

Additionally does anyone have any good scientific sources that would be a good start for me to read regarding evidence for human caused climate change?

GWP* or GWP100 for accounting for methane emissions from cows.,"I have been reading a bit about GWP\* lately. For you who dont know what it is, here is a paper discussing it:  [https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab6d7e](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab6d7e)

[(or you can watch this explanation)](https://youtu.be/Gw7_qwT6IVI?t=296).

GWP\* is a way of determining the Global Warming Potential of GHGs based on changes in their emission rate. Lets look at the the methane emissions from cows as an example. If a countries cow population is kept constant, than the methane emissions from the cows would not further increase the global temperature, because the methane in the atmosphere is eventually broken down in to CO2. And since the total CO2 emmisions is not increased (due to the gases being in a closed system), the total warming potential of the methane from cows would be zero.

This would greatly affect how we rank food based on their environmental impact, which would make beef not look as bad as before.

Any insights/opinions in to GWP\* vs GWP100 would be interesting. Which one is ""better""?",x4pr7r,10,0.81,2,1662195234.0
What are some climate policies that started in California and scaled to the US or beyond?,"In my reading about climate change, I stumbled on some cases where clean-air and climate-change policies started in California and then scaled to other places. For example...

* In the 1960s, California adopted CAAQS, which regulated airborne pollutants like nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide. In 1971, the US EPA enacted a similar policy called NAAQS, which applies to the whole United States. (admittedly these substances aren't really greenhouse gases, but they're still pollutants that are worth reducing.) \[1\]
* In 2002, the California Air Resources Board passed AB 1493, which limits tailpipe emissions from cars. By 2006, 10 states had adopted the same policy. \[2\]

This got me wondering: is California (or any other specific state) a good ""proving ground"" for new climate policies that can potentially be adopted nationwide?

How does Climate affect human behavior and politics?,"So, I want to embark on a research on the effects of climate on the political and economic development of the state. Since the people in this subreddit have been interested in the effects of climate on the world I thought it would be relevant to post here. 

What I have noticed is that the most of violent revolutions the world went through in the last millennia coincided with the Little Ice Age (1600-1700s), during which average harvest per acre of land fell, paving way for famines and battered living standards. Angry and hungry, the mobs revolted. This is just one example of how the changes in climate have come to shape world's history and politics.



In the modern world, almost all of the governments of the northernmost countries such as Canada, Iceland, Sweden, Finland, Norway (with Russia being an exception) are socialist-leaning. These countries also have the lowest crime and mortality rates in the world. Or, if you look at the behavior of humans living in different climatic regions, it seems as if the colder the area's temperature gets the more tempered and less violent the people become (compare, for example, Arabs, Persians, Turks vs. Poles, Czechs, Dutch). I acknowledge that this can simply be a random correlation, and I may be falling into a post hoc fallacy where there is a third factor that has caused the difference. Yet, I want to give this idea a fresh look. I would like to hear your thoughts.

[One source of many](http://observer.com/2017/02/noaa-fake-global-warming-data-paris-agreement-climate-change/):

> But the NOAA’s urgent action, says Dr. Bates, was to manipulate what’s known as the “version 4” dataset. The agency “took reliable readings from buoys but then ‘adjusted’ them upwards—using readings from seawater intakes on ships that act as weather stations,” writes the Mail. “They did this even though readings from the ships have long been known to be too hot.”

...

> The NOAA revelations are shades of the 2009 “Climategate” scandal, in which hacked emails from the University of East Anglia’s Climatic Research Unit indicated that its scientists were suppressing information contrary to their global-warming agenda. A similar batch of 5,000 emails released in 2011 showed likewise and, furthermore, reported Forbes, illustrated that the “scientists view global warming as a political ‘cause’ rather than a balanced scientific inquiry” and that “many of these scientists frankly admit to each other that much of the science is weak and dependent on deliberate manipulation of facts and data.”

My friend denies climate change based on the arguments I've listed. Can anyone help me to refute?,"Below is what he's sent to me, and I don't know enough to know if anything he says is true, or if he's fitting things to his beliefs.


If CO2 is 20% of the greenhouse gases (the highest percent I could find! It's actually only 5%)
And of that, 25% ( the highest percent I could find! It's actually only about 7%) of that is man made .

And only 16% of that is from US.

So let me put it in perspective:
Of the 680,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere

136,000 tonnes would be from CO2 (20% at the most!

Of that 34,000 tonnes (25% at the most) are man made

Of that, the U.S. Is responsible for 5,425 tonnes (16%)

That means the U.S. At the HIGHEST numbers I could find, Can 
control 8% (actually less than 1%) of the greenhouse gases.
If the U.S. Could control the entire world, it would still only amount to 5% control of the greenhouse gases!!

That means if the entire world would totally eliminate producing any CO2, it would only eliminate 5% of the greenhouse gases!

Now, how much control does the U.S. Have over global warming???

Now: the most popular percentages:
CO2 makes up only 5% of the greenhouse gases!!
Man made makes up only .3% of that!!
Now, redo my figures and how much influence does the U.S. Or even man, have on our climate?

"Advice needed - spectral analysis of paleo climate proxy data, for a project.","Hello, sorry if this isn't the right place to ask things like this.... mods feel free to delete if this isn't ok.

I am a university student who is currently undertaking a paleo-oceanography project, primarily looking at oxygen isotope values captured in marine sediment cores.

I am wanting to do some kind of spectral analysis to see how well oxygen isotope values align with milankovitch cycles over the last 1.5Ma or so.

Initially I was wanting to use R software to do this, and I may find a way to do it, it's just that to my knowledge, to do this my time series data needs to be in equal intervals before undertaking spectral analysis.

Reading research papers on the topic it seems that paleo climate proxy data needs to be interpolated somehow before spectral analysis is done, or researchers normally use software specifically 
designed for dealing with unevenly spaced time series data.

So.... my question is, can anyone recommend some good freely available software to aid me in this, or some simple method to transform my data to equal intervals....",l6munx,10,1.0,2,1611804607.0
Agriculture Methane,"Hi team, wondering if anyone can shed some light for me.  


I keep hearing that we dont need to worry about methane produced by agriculture because its a closed system (cows eat grass, belch methane, which is returned into the regrown pasture) and also because the methane is removed in 12 years.  


However I thought that methane was a more potent greenhouse gas than CO2 and also thought that methane breaks down into CO2 which would continue the greenhouse effects.  


Can anyone explain more to me?

The Holocene temperature conundrum,"This [paper](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/34/E3501) to me is an interesting case-study of ""hindcasting"" with climate models.

""significant discrepancy between the Holocene global cooling inferred from proxy reconstructions and simulated warming in climate models reflects the Holocene temperature conundrum, which poses an important test for our understanding of climate changes and for the evaluation of climate models of their climate sensitivity to GHGs, ice sheets, orbital insolation, and volcanic forcings.""

"" If the M13 reconstruction is correct, it will **imply major biases across the current generation of climate models**. ""

"" the volcanic forcing and **solar variability are not included in our transient simulation** throughout the Holocene ([**Fig. 2**](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/34/E3501#F2)), partly because of the lack of an accurate reconstruction throughout the Holocene. ""

How to get into Climate Science?,"Hi Redditers

First of all, respect, I found this community a month back it's awesome!

Would mean a lot if someone can give an idea on how to get into climate science, background below:

**Background**: I did my underad in electrical engineering 2 years back (studied data science by taking some courses like AI, Probabilistic Models etc. ). Currently I work in a large american investment bank and my job, though interesting in itself does not motivate me much. But over the last 2 years I've learnt a lot about my domain but don't forsee much more to learn. I do primarily NLP but am also well versed with Image Classification kind of methods, I worked on them in college.

I eventually want to move to Climate Science applications of data science, analyzing geographical and weather data etc. So what are the possible options to do that?

I considered going for MS but it'll be too expensive plus it may not give enough exposure to climate science methods.

How to stay hopeful in the current political/news climate? (pun not intended...),"In the months since Trump's election, I've found myself becoming more hopeless every day. It's really starting to affect my mental health. I've been depressed for years, but it was always about personal things - things I could fix. This is not something I can fix, and I don't know how to cope. 

I remember being 10 years old and crying to my parents because I was so afraid of climate disaster. I'm 17 now, and that fear has only grown. I find myself wishing I could go back to a time when this wasn't on my mind constantly. Hell, I've even read climate denier rhetoric in an desperate effort to calm myself. But nothing helps. Every day I see more news articles predicting our doom. My environmental science class isn't helping either. I've become aware of every bit of pollution I see. Being in nature is less comforting now, because all I notice are the blemishes. I find myself compelled to pick up every piece of garbage I see, and yet I don't, because my social anxiety is too strong (but that's another issue.)

I've been noticing changes in the world around me. I'm a birder, and this year several species of birds migrated north months early. It scares me. Birds are my passion, and they are expected to be hit hard by climate change. I hope to dedicate my life to preserving them, but what if its too late? I don't want to live to see these amazing creatures die. 

To make it even worse, I'm in my last year of high school and I have basically zero friends. There's nobody I can talk to about this, or about anything. And making friends has become harder too, because fear is always on my mind, and the end of the world isn't a good conversation starter. 

Basically, I'm at a loss. I could really use some words of comfort right now (then again, I'm sure all of us could.) I want to stay hopeful, I really do - but its becoming harder by the day. If you know of any videos or articles on climate change that end on a positive note, I would love if you could link them to me. I just need to know the world isn't doomed. I need a reminder that there are people working to fight this, and that I can be one of them. 

Thank you for reading - I hope I didn't depress anyone too much. We're all in this together, whether we like it or not. ",643olf,9,1.0,18,1491604926.0

Heartland Institute to bring climate denial charade to Paris talks; is seeking funding via Indiegogo,"
The Heartland Institute, located in suburban Chicago, is a wealthy group of right-wing activists who issue position papers, particularly to lawmakers. Their website states that they are very successful at getting their message to lawmakers and influencing votes. Their annual operating budget is about $6million, according to the UK Guardian.
I experienced their efficacy first-hand when I went to US Rep Todd Rokita's town hall meeting this summer and was given a Heartland Institute paper denying climate change.
Heartland has long positioned themselves as ""outsiders"" despite receiving money from major corporations including Exxon. Their vast corporate funding has enabled them to hold their own ""Symposiums"" for the past several years, at which climate change deniers have presented their papers. Those people then cite each other and their participation in order to create an illusion of scientific legitimacy.
Now Heartland is using the Indiegogo platform to raise money so they can go to Paris and disrupt the climate change talks with their denial nonsense.
It is clear Heartland is exploiting Indiegogo's image by creating a false affiliation with independent thinkers. The reality is the Heartland Institute are not thinkers and certainly not independent. They have been a key part of the well-funded climate denial machine.
Please urge Indiegogo to refuse to let Heartland exploit their image in this way. We need progress on climate change, not more denial.

How will climate change affect winter storms and swell?,"

I asked a similar question in r/surfing a couple of months ago:

How will the pole‘s ice melting affect the low pressure systems, known in the surfing world as ground swell( huge storms traveling between 30 degrees latitude and 60 degrees latitude),especially in the northern hemisphere?

With the ice of the poles melting, the temperature difference between the poles and the mid lattitudes in the air will likely decrease. This will in turn produce less big storms in Winter, which will ultimately produce less ground swell all around the world, but in particular in the northern hemisphere. Here the ice is melting first. 

That’s what i think could be happening. I read articles that stated storms will get more extreme. But i think that is only true for tropical storms. 

What do you think?
How will this affect the waves and Surf all over the world? In particular Europe and Northern America ? Do you agree with my hypothesis?
I for my part could imagine, we will not be able to see a change happening in the next 10-20years, but ultimately groundswells will get weaker over time. Cyclones and warm weather storms might occur more frequent.",hxmsby,8,0.84,4,1595684014.0

Why are temperatures so volatile between 1663 and 1735 in the Central England Temperature record?,"Hello r/climate_change, hope you're all enjoying your weekend!

Yesterday the YouTuber, Academic Agent, posted a [video](https://youtu.be/AW8QkIKcZBE) where he asks why climate change ""evangelists"" use CET graphs starting in [1772](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadcet/graphs/HadCET_graph_ylybars_uptodate.gif) instead of [1663](https://notalotofpeopleknowthat.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/cet-means_htm_m1e2281f3.jpg). He suggests that the volatile temperatures between 1663 and 1735 weaken the claim that manmade climate change is an imminent threat.

I looked it up and found out CET monthly means have been recorded since 1663 and daily means since 1772. However, I still don't understand why 1663 isn't always used as a starting point or why the temperatures seem so volatile. 

I'd appreciate hearing your thoughts!

Questions about climate sensitivity and methane,"Hello. I'm a lay person and I've been trying to get a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of our climate and its warming. I have some questions about climate sensitivity and methane and I'm hoping to get some overall idea if my thought processes are on track.

From what I've read, the direct climate sensitivity of CO2 is 1.2C. Due to net positive feedback mechanisms the overall sensitivity is expected to be a range with highest probability around 3C. And the warming effect is logarithmic due to the ways that the CO2 molecules interact with each other, so for every doubling of atmospheric concentration of CO2 the average warming potential of a CO2 molecule should halve.

I've usually seen the 1.2C figure given for CO2, but occasionally for the CO2e of all greenhouse gasses. The former makes a lot more sense to me because molecules like CO2, CH4, N2O, etc have different absorption spectra and therefore should not interfere with each other.

So that should mean that CO2 and eg CH4 have their own distinct climate sensitivities. I've tried to find a reference for CH4 climate sensitivity but couldn't find one - assuming that the concept even makes sense, is this a well known value among climate scientists? The instantaneous global warming potential of CH4 is said to be about 125 times that of CO2, while the atmospheric concentration of CO2 (~405ppm) is about 225 times that of CH4 (~1.8ppm), so it would at least seem that CH4 has lower sensitivity; if CH4 were raised to 405ppm would that mean that its instantaneous GWP is 0.56x that of CO2? Would that mean that its climate sensitivity is about 0.67C? I could see the area under the curve of CH4's absorption spectrum being about that size of CO2's but I don't know if that's a reasonable check. I suspect this is very wrong because atmospheric CH4 has roughly doubled since pre-industrial times, while atmospheric CO2 has only increased by about 44% - so if these numbers were right I'd expect CH4 to have had a much larger contribution to global warming than is normally reported.

The 3C median sensitivity figure is normally given with respect to CO2. But since the feedbacks (ice melting, clouds moving higher in altitude and towards the poles, increased water vapor retention, etc causing change in albedo and retained atmospheric energy) seem to be mostly dependent on heat shouldn't they apply cumulatively to the radiative forcing of all GHGs? In other words, instead of 3C CO2 sensitivity it should be X sensitivity (> 3C?) for total CO2e. Is the 3C value somehow normalizing out non-CO2 GHGs? Paleo-CO2 seems to track CH4 at the very least, so maybe they could be balanced proportionately. But current and future anthropomorphic emissions may not be.

Finally, let's say that somehow we reverted net GHG emissions back to pre-industrial. And let's say CO2 concentration then stays about the same, ignoring the effect of semi-permanent sequestration from the ocean and plant life. I'd expect CH4 concentration would gradually decrease back to pre-industrial levels as it's oxidized in the atmosphere. Would the result be a an eventual significant net cooling below the equilibrium temperature we're currently on track to meet?

In my mind mitigating CH4 emissions seems like a more tractable problem for humanity than reducing CO2 emissions, since we're not binding CH4 to release energy but are releasing it as a waste product (in much smaller quantity), and there are a lot of ideas on how to curb this. Would that make CH4 mitigation worthy of even more attention than CO2 mitigation is?",6x448c,8,0.79,11,1504146265.0
