For me, global warming is a violation of the non-aggression pact since it affects us all, including ourselves. It is scientifically proven damage and in the future it can cause tremendous damage to society and at the same time to me. 

Of all the areas, the only one where I am open to certain state intervention is in the environment. I would like strong funding from somewhere (private better) and an very aggressive response to combat climate change for example a carbon tax would be good as Elon Musk himself said

I know that us Libertarians are very skeptical of the government but is it possible to obtain that without state help?

However, every time we see polls (not a great indicator, but still) which show that most people (even on the right) couldn't care less about the latest ""Unsexy MnM"" according to Tucker or the latest ""trans panic"" from Matt Walsh.

Therefore, in the months leading up to every election (speaking as a purple state resident), they ratchet-up the crime-fear which seems to motivate that remaining 70+ plus the so-called ""moderates.""

This is obviously a huge contentious issue in the suburbs (and rural areas to a degree, but not as much as you might think), and doesn't seem to be working as much now on the youth population increasingly concerned with the big 3: climate change, Healthcare, and (either) education or housing. Still, though. Without fail, people come out to vote for more cops and kicking out the homeless, or buy into the ""tough on crime"" bs over and over again.

I've had some success convincing people that crime is a downstream issue, that crime could be solved by eliminating the conditions that create poverty, since poverty creates crime (and I consistently find subtle race ""beliefs"" underlying this, what a shocker) but still many are unmoved.

TLDR: My question would be, in y'alls opinion, either conjecture or from experience, what do you think is the best way to combat this narrative?",22,2,1680484085.0

It honestly feels like noone genuinely gives a fuck about the multitude of issues that are plaguing our society and planet. Some students on my campus are occupying a building to protest the uni's ties to a bunch of weapon contractors, which is great imo, but everyone I know is like ""why are they doing that it won't make any difference"" or ""I don't really care they're being an inconvenience"".

It's a similar to the Just Stop Oil protests - do people really care more about being late for work or missing a few lectures than they do about potentially civilisation-ending climate change or about the military-industrial complex which contributes to millions of deaths per year? To me it seems like the answer is yes, and that is super depressing rn.

I (perhaps naively) thought I would find some kindred spirits at uni, but now I dread going to social events for the fear of having to explain for the 50th time why I think companies that design missiles and drones aren't, in fact, ""not that bad"" and that it's not ""ok because they make cars as well"".

Sorry for the long post, this is more a rant than anything else, but if anyone else is feeling something similar please feel free to comment. And if you have any suggestions as to how to feel less hopeless I'd love to hear your thoughts :)",208,45,1666801412.0
100gn5s,Anarchism,"From a comrade with OCD, Thank You Anarchism for a wonderful year",Flashy_Network2042,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/100gn5s/from_a_comrade_with_ocd_thank_you_anarchism_for_a/,"Hey everyone, as we venture into a new year, I just wanted to give a thank you to all the anarchists in the online community and to anarchism as a whole. While the year was far from perfect, anarchism has been one of the most important ideas to me in navigating life, and it has vastly improved my mental health and overall happiness.



For some context, I'm a university student whose had OCD their whole life -- sometimes mild, sometimes life threatening. I tend to overthink everything, and I'm often frozen by decisions as simple as what to wear for the day. I need to be 100% sure of everything I do, and it makes social interactions, writing essays, and even just following a routine super difficult. It's difficult to write down exactly what my thought spirals consist of, but they usually revolve around a fear of failing in the capitalist system or causing others to fail under capitalism. As a result, I've lived most of my life without much confidence in my actions or my voice, and I'm passive in almost every situation, waiting for orders or decisions made by others.



However, for the past year, I've been lurking on r/Anarchy101 and slowly learning about anarchism, and over the summer, I bought my first book and solidified myself as an anarchist. I was able to see how capitalism had completely warped my self-worth and how hierarchy destroys human initiative and passion. I could already feel a change in my mindset and happiness simply by browsing r/Anarchy101, but reading an actual book sped up my growth quite a bit.



I felt most of the impact of anarchism over the previous semester. I didn't do anything particularly anarchist or dramatic like start a reading group or mutual aid group (I don't think I'm ready for that haha,) but I did get a leadership position for one of my clubs, and I tried managing a team using anarchy as a basis. It didn't go exactly as planned since the club is not anarchist, but we were pretty successful. I was able to navigate a huge amount of uncertainty despite my OCD, because I had anarchism to prop up a newfound confidence in my decisions. No one has the right to rule me, and I have the right to rule no one, and that idea has helped me escape many obsessive thought spirals. Had I tried this a year ago, I probably would have broken down in the first few weeks.



I've had a lot of other small successes as well. I can feel my relationship with my partner improving, as I'm better at making decisions/setting boundaries without letting either of us being dominant/coercive. I've become more social, as I can really feel the anarchist dynamics in socializing and the role of initiating/organizing a group. I'm even starting to appreciate my OCD; without capitalism dictating what has value in my life, I can see that OCD gives me a unique perspective on the world and creative ways of navigating it, even if those ways don't directly produce commodities or monetary value.



My life isn't perfect now that I've found anarchism. I've got a ways to go in terms of organizing beyond myself and managing my mental health, and mental health is unfortunately a separate (though intertwined) topic from capitalism. But I've felt quite an improvement over this year and I feel like I have a direction towards greater anarchist organization in the future. I want to thank everyone here and over at r/Anarchy101 for being amazing. I don't think I would've found anarchism otherwise and I wouldn't be on this path without everyone's support, even if it's anonymous. It's changed my life for the better and I'm looking forward to whats to come, even in the face of capitalism, systemic oppression, and a seemingly inevitable climate catastrophe. We will continue fighting for a better world through it all.



Happy new year, comrades. I hope this post helped you start this one on a positive note.",86,5,1672567549.0
zledxp,Anarchism,ecologists: what are some schools of thought for autonomous restoration/land defense that combine low-budget western science with traditional knowledge?,Procioniunlimited,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/zledxp/ecologists_what_are_some_schools_of_thought_for/,"Please: teach how to fish, not give a fish.

In theory i have a western science background that gave me foundational understanding of ecosystems, plants, animals, microorganisms, chemistry, soil, water, geology, climate, and how these things all interact and make up the world. That foundational understanding allows me to look at almost any problem and have a starting point for understanding why it is happening, what is out of balance, and how to help the system start rebalancing itself.

But western science is fraught with colonial attitudes, productivity and economic priorities, and the funding and decision-making mechanisms behind most ""western-science-based"" restoration mean that it is often misoriented, mediocre, inadequate in scope, selectively ignorant, or only addressing symptoms. people regularly mistake data for reality and live/work in a space of numbers and grant metrics rather than the real state of balance of the land.

The people who are really in a position to care for the land are those who live in each area--the people as a whole who use the land for subsistence, who have a personal emotional relationship with the living things, and especially who have cultural ties to a place. But science done in the western (esp. gov agency) way is not affordable for autonomous anticapitalist projects--some low budget measurement options exist for some metrics and are worth exploring, but overall we need to move toward a type of understanding the world that is based on visual and personal observation of natural relationships, an intuitive but science-based understanding of the world that doesn't need to work through the nonprofit-industrial complex. Traditional knowledge is perfect here, but it needs to be able to work on decimated and changing ecosystems and not rely on static historical knowledge--it needs to be not just traditional knowledge but a complete (new) traditional way of understanding.  Traditional knowledge can come with a pitfall of partial understanding or superstitious understanding that would apply itself into situations with the wrong context. And sometimes inaccurate assumptions are spread by word of mouth through colonized people and mistaken as traditional knowledge. None of that will do in the caring of the land and water.

I will restate my orientation: we need a way to understand the world that can be practiced without scientific instruments (or skeletal budget/diy) but that reflects scientific ecological realities and grants a type of understanding that can check itself for errors and can spread from person to person without formal science education, a type of understanding that can correctly interpret any changing or new situation in the face of increasing ecogenocide by state actors and industrial hegemony.

Who has been working on this?

PS: an example for more clarity:

>on-stream cattle watering and on-stream logging and clearcut logging have caused elevated sediment levels in many streams in my area. When this nutrient-laden sediment reaches the lakes it allows unbalancedly large algal blooms that can make the water toxic and that drastically compromise the survival of juvenile endemic fish. Cash cropping ag irrigation draws the lake levels lower and exacerbates the blooms and the fish mortality. Back on the top end of the watershed, the sediment load in the streams causes greater erosion and channel downcutting that lowers the river level and correspondingly, the groundwater level, so much that the bank becomes inhospitable for riparian plants--the loss of which accelerates erosion.

This is not every factor at play here, but it will work for an example--the type of understanding we need is one that could diagnose these imbalances down to the root cause without needing a laboratory and then act to balance them through autonomous means, perhaps through a combination of knowledge of the historical conditions and the knowledge of the process of becoming degraded, basic scientific measurement tools, or simple natural observation like an old-school naturalist.",28,18,1670983672.0
10mh2kv,Anarchism,Has anybody seen the movie First Reformed? Spoilers,cqandrews,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/10mh2kv/has_anybody_seen_the_movie_first_reformed_spoilers/,"The movie follows a very similar path to Taxi Driver (same writer) of an isolated loner who falls down the rabbit hole to ""extremism.""

The topic of said rabbit hole in the movie is environmental destruction and the responsibility of the individual to stop it.

I liked the movie at first, seeing as it painted the polluting Corporate executive at blatantly corrupt and unlikable and Ethan Hawke's character finding some ambition in life through his discovery of activism.

Where I think the movie fell apart was the typical neo liberal cop out ending. Ethan Hawke sees his love interest show up to the church event he told her not to come to and is forced to stop his planned bombing of the church and previously mentioned exec for her sake, instead presumably opting to use non violent protest, wrapping himself in barbed wire to be presented to the congregating.

But in the final act he is kept from even that as his love interest finds him preparing for the event and they embrace fully for the first time before credits roll (assuming that wasn't a last dying vision from his cancer.)

My problem is the movie goes out of its way to show the scientific concensus on the dangers of climate change and environmental destruction and how it is carried out not just by the evil overlords warned of in biblical verses, but also by the apathy of well meaning but ineffective holy men and those with larger personal issues.

I think this is a typical case of popular media trying to have something profound to say in criticizing large problems faced by society but at the same time trying to ride some political fence of spineless centrism in its execution of its ""solution."" Not to say there isn't a time and a place for peaceful protest but I'm tired of the only media protagonists being allowed to use force as a means of resolution are borderline fascist propaganda ""superheroes"" for children's movies, superheros who only use said force to maintain a status quo",3,2,1674812696.0

v5rvr5,Anarchism,"I'm sorry, I don't know where else to talk about this. CNN is running an article wherein an ex cop talks about why it's so dangerous for ""civilians"" to own AR-15's.",BriNeedsSleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/v5rvr5/im_sorry_i_dont_know_where_else_to_talk_about/,"[Link to the Article.](https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/05/opinions/guns-ar-15-uvalde-school-shooting-fanone/index.html)

They changed the title. It used to be, ""I own an AR-15. Here's why you shouldn't."" And it includes lines such as:

"" The AR-15 has the dubious distinction of being America's most popular semi-automatic rifle. I'm more familiar with the gun than most people: I own one. And one thing I know for sure is that this weapon doesn't belong in the hands of the average civilian.""

and

"" I can't overstate how dangerous it is to have semi-automatic weapons like the AR-15 in the hands of civilians. Our public officials have it within their power to help make it harder for people who shouldn't have these weapons to get them.

A police officer should never have to worry about being outgunned by the bad guy they're protecting the public against.""

and

""I've pressed some customers about why they want an AR-15, but no one could ever come up with a legitimate justification for needing that particular weapon.

Some members of the tinfoil hat brigade have come up with the reply, ""We need these weapons because we want to be effective against the government if it becomes tyrannical. That's part of our Second Amendment right."" Personally, I think that's ludicrous, but it has become an increasingly popular justification for purchasing a semi-automatic rifle.""

Rant time:

Daily reminder that the Taliban fucking won. I read on the BBC a report from the Pentagon said the army could last 8 years under home deployment operations. 8 years. The Taliban lasted 20. It's not a ""tinfoil hat"" position to want to have some sort of defense against a tyrannical government. ""A police officer should never have to worry about being outgunned,"" is such a terrifying sentiment.

This would give the state a monopoly on violence. It already has one practically, but disarming the American populace would only further that. You know what we should do, instead of disarm the populace, is institute public health measures and anti-poverty measures, and tackle the root causes of poverty, radicalization, extremism, mental health crises, and so on. We would hopefully have thorough background checks as we instituted this. Of course, it won't happen, but to completely take the teeth from the American populace is dangerous.

Liberals are so gone that they'll trust an ex cop telling them they shouldn't own a method of self defense. Canada just blocked handgun imports. I'm worried that the line won't stop with AR-15's, not to invoke the slippery slope fallacy, but it's true I feel. They'll disarm us and then they'll slaughter us. Us being Anarchists, LGBTQ+ people, the Left^(TM) and the BIPOC and everyone else who isn't them.

Climate catastrophe is coming. Economic collapse is coming. Eventually, it will be upon us, and I refuse to give up any ground when it comes to arms ownership. This is the Imperial Core. It is a government of tyranny and slavery, and I refuse to give up my guns to my slave masters. You should too.

I understand that after the Uvalde massacre, the instinct is to jump on an AR-15 ban. But we should've had systems in place to produce a healthy society that doesn't create such mass murderers in the first place. I blame capitalism for what happened; there, I said it. It is capitalism's fault. Theoretically we could all own AR-15's and be safe, in a society where that was the norm, in a society where we took care of each other, in a society where we work for the good of each other. I understand this society seems far fetched, and it certainly won't happen in my lifetime, but again, disarming the American populace is *not* the answer.

What is, then? I'm not sure. But I know that when Climate Change finally comes knocking to reap what we've sown in all it's fury and hatred, I plan on being armed. You might not feel the same, and that's ok. But when there is lots of food, there is lots of problem. When there is no food, there is only one problem. And trust me, you're gonna want a gun for it.

Edit: Hi all, I'm still looking for the source on that 8 year Pentagon claim. I would swear on it that I read it on the BBC during the 2020 BLM protests. But as I'm searching, I'm not finding it. I apologize for this.

Edit 2: This is amateur math, but if the Taliban had 75000 fighters, and the war in Afghanistan cost 300 million dollars a day, and 75000 is .1875% of the population of Afghanistan. Then, we could take .1875% and apply it to Americans with guns who would fight back. This gives us  656250 potential fighters. That's a 775% increase in fighters for the Army to deal with. Across a playing field much wider and more vast than Afghanistan. Applying those numbers, the potential military spending would skyrocket to 2.32 billion dollars a day, to crack down on an insurrection in the states. Yearly, that's roughly 874 billion dollars. The yearly defense budget for the military is 733 billion dollars. The deficit there would be astounding. I'm sorry I couldn't find the report but best I figure, martial law in the US wouldn't last too long. Again, just my humble amateur math. And for the record, I failed algebra twice.",208,230,1654479915.0
yn4k5r,Anarchism,"My take on Anarchy ""realism"".",Old_Harry7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/yn4k5r/my_take_on_anarchy_realism/,"Anarchism by its principles cannot operate on coercion, one must come to its own conclusions and based on said conclusion join the anarchist struggle, this paradigm makes anarchy's manpower a problem and therefore if a revolution were to happen then it's clear to me it would be an ""imposed revolution"" by a minority anarchist group and this contradicts anarchism in its core beliefs. Expanding on this an anarchist ""revolutionary state"" (I know big contradiction) would then be forced to compete and defend itself from internal rebellions and foreign powers therefore forcing the revolution on authoritarian grounds. A world revolution would then be imperative for anarchist to succeed thus what said previously would apply to the entire world (a minority group forcing an ideology on the rest of the world wide population).

Is there no solution then? I don't think so, I believe that through education and international communities around the globe an anarchist major consensus might be feasible, it requires dedication and a constant struggle against the opposing propaganda but thanks to the internet this could be done. Capitalism is impoverishing the vast majority of the population and it's leading the world to its death through climate change, this things cannot be hidden any longer by the statists/capitalists but these same phenomenons coild be used against our struggle through propaganda (the rise of fascism and anti-leftism are witnesses to this) therefore our action must focus on educating people and show through local praxis the benifts of an anarchist society.

But I can always find holes in these policies. Sometimes though, I really doubt myself and wonder if I am too outside the mainstream in my criticism.

But I also look around and see a throughly broken system. Labor exploitation, third world sweatshops, nazis marching in the streets, recession, crisis, climate change, all that. Hell we nearly had a Fascist coup in the US.

To an outsider, decrying capitalism or hierarchy as the root of all evil means as little as fascists pointing to racial minorities or 'foreign subversion' and claiming the same things. What the left has that fascists and liberals severely lack, and something that I personally see very little of in the messaging of modern anarchist/socialist spaces, is a clear and desirable view of the future.

What do the liberals promise to those who see the world outside their window? As wealth inequality grows more drastic, as homes become more expansive, as state overreach extends farther and further into private lives, and as climate change threatens to bring our planet to ecological collapse in less than a century, what's the moderate solution? Nothing. There is no solution. Other than a vague allusion of gradual change and slow, measured progress that completely disregards the urgency of our present situation. ""Just trust us - and maybe by the end of your lifetime, the world will be just a little bit less awful. So long as everything goes according to plan.""

For the fascists, it's even worse. You can't get people on board with tyranny, only convince them that it's necessary. That it's the 'only sure way' to change. For some, this is persuasive as it promises the immediate action that liberal governments are incapable of. But of course, such actions are never focused on ensuring the welfare of citizenry but instead the purging of undesirables and state supremacy for its own sake.

Conversely, anarchism does not need to hide any of its desired outcomes to make itself palatable to the public. In fact, the universal attractiveness of our beliefs is something that ought to be put front and center. What we provide is a vision of the future for humanity. What do we want? We want you to be fed if there is food, housed if there is housing, cared for when ill, and to not have to worry about these human needs being threatened by a government or employer. We want to make a world where all people, regardless of race, religion, sex, presentation, or any other immutable qualities, are guaranteed the unconditional security of their well being by right of being human. Not something earned through wage-labor, or provided as a birthright to the privileged upper classes.

We want a world organized according to the needs of people, not the whims of capitalists. Where work can be made efficient, fulfilling, voluntary - an act to enrich your community, yourself, or the world we all live in. We want people to live as people, not the subordinates of those who lucked their way into power, or safeguard it behind the barrel of a gun. Even the most surface-level dismissals of leftist thought are never in judgement of our ideals. Most view it as a matter of practicality. ""It's a good idea on paper, but in reality..."" You get the picture. But should we not strive for the best of all possible worlds? Are we wrong for looking at the sorry state of the planet and thinking we can and ought to do better? Of course not.

So let that be our message. Anyone can look at our current state of affairs and broadly claim, ""This is awful."" It's not unique or persuasive, even if we take for granted our reasoning for such awfulness to be correct. The greatest draw of anarchism is to give that picture of the world to someone, and then say to them, ""Here's how we make things better.""",103,13,1655139960.0
uo7r7a,Anarchism,Anthropocentrism = Human Supremacist Ideology,IncindiaryImmersion,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/uo7r7a/anthropocentrism_human_supremacist_ideology/,"Lately I've been seeing an excessive amount of comments and posts that seem to deny the current state of Ecological science and our rapidly spiralling Climate Crisis/Mass Extinction process.(EDIT: for clarification I meant across various Anarchist subs, not strictly this one.) During these conversations it's often insisted by many individuals that we can not scale back or change trajectory from our collective tech-obsession and for-profit production because many people would/will die. Yet many people are dying daily within this society model, and a mass extinction process entails the vast majority of the life on the planet dying. Especially if any of us claim to be Anarchists, or opposed to all hierarchy, then we similarly can not treat Humanity either as monolithic, nor as if it is important beyond all other living creatures on this planet. That turns the Self-Preservation intention into a Human Supremacy stance, Human lives and desires above any and all else, even if the whole fucking planet ends up dying out because of this stubborn insistence on collective arrogance.  So this argument seems like a pseudo-moralism to me, being as continuing Capitalism is a guarantee of each human being exploited until thier deaths.

 Focusing efforts toward interrupting the For-Profit Death Cult that is Capitalism is my main concern here. That would be the fastest means of interrupting vast Ecocide. In that process, I'm well aware of the personal risks and the fact that any kind of confrontation, or supply chain disruption could lead to my own death.  Especially being that I am a disabled person.  However, choosing to do nothing or bet on gradualist approaches is choosing to let everyone die.  So if we are definitely all fucked if we choose to do nothing, and we're potentially fucked regardless what we may attempt, then it makes the most sense to make an attempt regardless the outcome rather than cling to gradualisms that rationally are leading toward our doom.  

 I guess I'm re-assessing my associations with individuals & groups as I'm not going to put any more efforts toward any of these groups who's plan is largely to avoid confrontation as we all work ourselves ragged for capitalist overlords until major collapse.  If that's the best plan that a group comes up with, then they're just letting everyone die while posturing with gradualisms and moral arguments in the mean time.  I personally can't get behind that.  It's making me disengage from a number of interactions both online and locally.  Narrowing down exactly whom I'm willing to do work with.",11,11,1652380371.0

1. An area of college life that you believe would be a great place to target for change. I'm thinking housing, tuition, climate change, and/or department funding. I want advice from others. I want big and small issues to tackle.
2. How you would organize a movement to address your selected issue and your approach to causing change

vmzyk8,Anarchism,Optimistic and pessimistic predictions of the future of the USA,Rickswan,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/vmzyk8/optimistic_and_pessimistic_predictions_of_the/,"What are your most optimistic and most pessimistic predictions for the future of the USA?

I'll go first: 

- best case scenario: people's class conscienceness continues to rise as they become jaded and unsatisfied with the current hierarchical systems that don't meet their needs; people build prefigurative, horizontally-structured institutions and strengthen their communities so if and when the country collapses, it can replace the old systems, and people's needs can still be met; progressive politicians are elected and hold back the encroaching tide of fascism long enough for people to organize and educate; the USA as it exists is peacefully dismantled both from within the system and by popular will over time as the older generations die off, and it is replaced with a more horizontal and egalitarian anarchist society.

- worst case scenario: things continue as they have been, the aristocratic caste successfully distracts the majority with scapegoats and deflection, and class consciousness does not significantly rise, with the majority of people continuing to be apathetic and selfish; progressive politicians continue to be a small minority in American politics; movements that push for change are captured and/or neutered; the majority of the ""moderate"" left does nothing as the right-wing continues to dismantle what little democracy and rights the country has left; the population of gullible, overworked, (intentionally) undereducated, and poor are easily convinced by right-wing populists to vote against their own class interests as we slide into a fascist theocracy; as the case with any system that doesn't meet the needs of the people, the country inevitably collapses and fragments, but the preexisting lack of class consciousness means anyone else seeking to seize power is likely to repeat the same problems of hierarchical oppression, so the cycle continues until a significant portion of the population embraces anarchist principles (if humanity even still exists post-climate crisis and possible nuclear holocaust).

I may be totally off base or alone about all this, so what are your predictions?",5,4,1656455915.0

We have a war that could very well become a world war. We have consequences of climate change already being felt.

We have a lot to grapple with. There is no comfort. Elections won't save us. Counting on corporations to do the right thing won't save us. No we have to face these threats head on. The world is ending, but maybe that's not a bad thing, only if we fight like hell and plant the seeds of a better world we'll get through this dark chapter.

Before anyone thinks that I'm being accelarationist when I say that the world ending isn't a bad thing. Let's first break down what I mean by the world. By world I mean civilization, what we humans have build over the years. By saying that the possible end of civilization is not a bad thing. I mean that it may offer us a better path. What that path is I don't know. But facing that uncertainty is better than what we are going through right now.

ugg1hk,Anarchism,I just read a review for The Sovereign Individual about the future and it sounds really anarchist to me,SchwarzerKaffee,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/ugg1hk/i_just_read_a_review_for_the_sovereign_individual/,"[Here's a link](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/82256.The_Sovereign_Individual) to the review which is formatted better. I'll paste the review below.

The review doesn't talk about anarchism, but it portrays a future but there are a lot of similarities to how I view anarchism developing.


KEY TAKEAWAYS/ACTIONABLES:
- Positioning: Healthcare vs Technology; Skills + Connections
- Career: These is no ""job"", just tasks/skills you complete. If you can teach yourself how to SOLVE PROBLEMS, you are ahead of the game.
- Social/Political: PERSONALIZED, Democratized power.
- Psychological: Losing Ikigai -- prioritize your CREATIVE OUTLET!!!
- Political: Set up mat in multiple countries
ACTIONABLE: Hone in on two skillsets in depth. Capitalize on becoming the best. The Top 1% will take 99% of customers.

The Transition of the Year 2000: The Fourth Stage of Human Society
1. Hunting and gathering societies
2. Agricultural societies
3. Industrial societies
4. Informational societies
- In the information age, a job will be a task that you do, not a thing that you have.
- As more money moves online, governments won’t be able to track or control it anymore. They’ll lose their power over commerce and won’t be able to treat their citizens as a farmer milking cows.
- The greatest resentment will likely be centered among the middle class in rich countries, they will feel they have the most to lose. Anyone receiving handouts from the government will resent the sovereign individuals who don’t support them.
- With technology increasing, we’ll move closer and closer to Neal Stephenson’s Metaverse in Snow Crash, where we live as much online as offline and conduct ourselves according to the online laws and customs, working in the cybereconomy.

Megapolitical Transformations in Historic Perspective
- You can’t rely on conventional information sources to give you an objective warning about how the world is changing and why. You have to FIGURE IT OUT YOURSELF!!!!!
- There are four key pieces to understanding megapolitcal changes:
1. LAND: Topography, the control and makeup of the land.
2. POWER: Climate, it’s change can precipitate major shifts in power. The 17th century was frought with social revolution.
3. HEALTHCARE: Microbes and disease can cause radical changes in power.
4. TECHNOLOGICAL: Technology plays the biggest and most impactful role in the new megapolitical changes though

East of Eden: The Agricultural Revolution and the Sophistication of Violence
- In the hunting gathering days, there was no reason to work more than the 10-15 hours a week you needed to do to secure food. Overkill was punished because the food would rot before it could be eaten, and decrease food available to you in the environment in the future.

The Last Days of Politics: Parallels Between the Decline of the Church and Nation-State
- Church vs Science compared to Government vs Science

The Life and Death of the Nation State
- The information age will require new mechanisms of representation and government to avoid chronic dysfunction and even social collapse. The past systems will break down as technology advances.

Megapolitics of the Information Age: The Triumph of Efficiency Over Power
- In the information age, if life becomes inoperable or undesirable in one location you’ll no longer be tied to it. You can simply leave and live elsewhere. A change in government could lead to companies fleeing overnight.
- Land resource: not limited by one place, portable
- Capital resource: lowered costs, lower barriers of entry and exit.
- Product cycle: obsolete faster, gains short-lived.
- Microprocessing: individualize work. low-skilled won't be able to contribute at all, builds resentment.
- One persons' contribution is exponential (even after death). Keep pushing boundaries, claiming frontiers, pulling away power from government.
- Power is democratized.

Transcending Locality: The Emergence of the Cyber Economy
1. Internet transactions
2. Long-distance (medical diagnosis, business, real estate)
3. Occurs outside jurisdiction
Trends: PERSONALIZED. Democratized.
Example: Used to be illegal to send fax. But those laws never last.

The End of Egalitarian Economics: The Revolution in Earnings Capacity in a World Without Jobs
- The minimum skill requirement increases for any meanignful contribution; therefore there will be more and more people at the bottom (99% to 99.9%)
- There's no ""jobs"", just skills/tasks to do. Example: movies (employed for the job, then go their separate ways).
- Abundant information. Knowledge is cheap. Skill is powerful (knowing how to use it).

Nationalism, Reaction, and the New Luddites
- Reaction is strongest in high standards of living (developed country), The neo-luddites will attract most of their adherents from the bottom ⅔ of income earners, underachievers with credentials who face downward mobility
- As it becomes easier to live comfortably and earn a high income anywhere, the pull to choose where to live based on price savings will be more appealing.
- if you want to take full advantage of the freedom of mobility, you should STAKE OUT A WELCOME MAT in multiple places beyond the one you were born in.
- Education: First, it was controlled by the Church. Then, it was controlled by the state. Now, it will be controlled and improved by technology, and it will be PERSONALIZED and INDIVIDUALIZED based on the student.
- People will CHOOSE THEIR JURISDICTIONS the same way they today choose their insurance carriers or religions. Jurisdictions that fail to provide a suitable mix of services will face bankruptcy and liquidation, like an incompetent business.

The Twilight of Democracy
- The information age will be the age of the independent contractor, rewarded based on PERFORMANCE and COMPETENCE, instead of the “company man.”

Morality and Crime in the Natural Economy of the Information Age
- increasingly valuable to be able to discern SIGNAL FROM NOISE!!!!!!! and know what to pay attention to (see Robert Greene).
1. The information overload puts a premium on brevity, which leads to abbreviation, which leaves out what is unfamiliar, which leaves out important parts of understanding the information.
2. There’s an increased value in broad OVERVIEWS and lower value of individual facts.
3. The growing tribalization and marginalization of life will STUNT DISCOURSE AND CRITICAL THINKING. Many people will shy away from conclusions that make them uncomfortable, even if they’re obvious.

Devolution and the Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns
- Losing a CREATIVE OUTLET!!! can lead to a nervous breakdown, we need an Ikigai, a reason to live.
- If you can teach yourself HOW TO SOLVE PROBLEMS, you have a bright career ahead of yourself. No matter where you live, you will find problems galore in need of solving. Those who would benefit from solutions of their problems will pay you handsomely to solve them.",0,0,1651460275.0

As I’ve gone through university and have had the chance to educate myself, I’ve realised more and more how bleak things are looking. 
-It doesn’t look like we’ll be tackling climate change in time
-somehow fascism is on the rise again, and we’re back to hating LGBT ? Wtf? I thought society had largely moved on from that to hating immigrants /s
-cost of living 
-the current state of education being framed as a competitive machine that generates the best workers (rather than yk, education having instrinsic value)
- more and more “leaders” that are anti-democratic bs rightwingers: Desantis, macron, sunak, Italy, mohdi 
-bureaucracy being made as complicated as possible in every possible manner to make people less likely to protest
-the state of media

People are still sucked in from years of anti-socialist propaganda and are totally sipping the cool aid.

There's something for every left-wing person at Marxism 2023. For those new to socialist politics, a dedicated stream of Marxism 101 sessions will provide an introduction to the fundamental ideas of Marxism. These sessions are the best place to find out what Marxist politics is all about, and to answer any questions you might have. There are also heaps of sessions dealing with more advanced elements of Marxist theory, discussing the history of capitalism and resistance, and making sense of the world today. (Over 100 sessions)
There will also be eye witnesses to revolutionary struggle!

Each session is made up of a talk by activists and experts in the field, followed by discussion. We strongly encourage participation from everyone, especially those newer to socialist politics. In the program you will find more information about each session, and some suggested readings to provide some background to the topic.

When:  April 7-9 (over the easter holidays)

The EcoAction Committee of the Green Party of the U.S. will hold a webinar forum on Monday, April 10 about the importance of this year’s [Earth Day to May Day](https://www.gp.org/earth_day_to_may_day_2023) activities. The event, which begins at 8:00 PM ET is part of the national day to build the [Green Party](http://www.gp.org/). 

RSVP is required. [Register here](https://us06web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZYpd-6trDoiGNOolXYBu18-HPEKTVsAWyRx#/registration) for the April 10 Forum.

The webinar will outline how green activists can build support for system change not climate change by organizing local educational events, protests, vigils, social media, LTE, call-ins, etc. from Earth Day (April 22) to May Day. An important part is building solidarity among the various movements demanding systemic change, such as Black Lives Matter, women’s rights, GLBQT, rights of nature, public power, peace, and worker and immigrant rights.

Speakers on April 10 will address the need for the climate movement to be [more anti-capitalist](http://gelfny.org/news-blog/avoiding-climate-collapse-requires-ending-capitalism/), as well as the need for an [Ecosocialist Green New Deal](https://www.gp.org/gpus_calls_for_a_green_new_deal); [biodiversity / RON](https://www.gp.org/biodiversity_and_the_rights_of_nature); ending [single-use plastics](https://www.gp.org/ecoaction_webinar_on_plastics) and halting fossil fuels; the role of the military on climate; and, how to promote Green living.

zyah61,socialism,Journalists in West Virginia face massive political corruption,atadams225,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/zyah61/journalists_in_west_virginia_face_massive/,"About a week ago, HD Media fired three reporters from the Charleston Gazette-Mail (HD Media's subsidiary) for being openly critical of HD Media's President Doug Skaff for hosting Don Blankenship on his webcast. For background, Blankenship was formerly the CEO of Massey Energy and served a year in prison for conspiring to willfully violate mine safety standards in connection to the 2010 Upper Big Branch disaster that killed 29 miners. While on Skaff's webcast, Blankenship bashed the media and denied climate change. Skaff concluded the episode by calling Blankenship a ""good guy."" 

In the past, Skaff directed the Gazette-Mail staff to remove a story detailing his conviction for cheating in a blackjack game, and they did. The story has since been reposted with an editor's note detailing that the decision to remove it was against company policy. 

In addition to being the president of HD Media, he is also serving as the minority leader in the WV House of Delegates, making him the highest-ranked Democrat in the body. His relationship to the WV Legislature and Democratic Party has led other politicians and public figures to attempt to influence Gazette-Mail reporting. One such figure, Barbara Fleischauer, former member of the WV House of Delegates, threatened a member of the Gazette-Mail with going above his head to Skaff if he did not ""correct"" a story in which she felt she was portrayed incorrectly. Situations like this are apparently common at the Gazette-Mail.  

More recently, reporter Amelia Knisely for West Virginia Public Broadcasting (WVPB) was fired after covering the Department of Health and Human Resources' (DHHR) treatment of people with disabilities. The DHHR's Cabinet Secretary Bill Crouch sent a six-page letter to the executive director of WVPB seeking a complete retraction of one of her articles detailing the WV Senate President's letter to the Governor requesting a formal investigation into the allegations against the DHHR. 

Knisely would go on to cover the Legislature's Joint Committee on Health, where legislators heard from the Disability Right West Virginia legal director and DHHR Secretary Crouch. After this, Crouch and the agency's spokeswoman Allison Adler contacted WVPB leadership and threatened to discredit WVPB if Knisely continued to report on the DHHR. In response, the WVPB executive director ordered Knisely to stop covering the DHHR. After internal struggles, WVPB decided to eliminate her position entirely. 

Politicians attempt to have direct control over what gets covered in the media—how often do they succeed? Government officials threaten media outlets to throw stories under the rug—how often do they succeed? How free is the ""free press"" in West Virginia? So many questions and we need help answering them.

10iphuk,socialism,Activists Are Criminals: Introducing the New Legislation Designed to Undermine Our Rights,causeapp,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/10iphuk/activists_are_criminals_introducing_the_new/," In just a few days, the House of Lords will vote to sign the controversial[ Public Order Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3153) into law. Its passing would mark the latest in a series of assaults against the democratic and human rights of public and peaceful assembly. With the Bill's readoption of many of the same measures thrown out last year by the Lords' review of the[ Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/32/contents), it is clear that there is a British legislative agenda that is unrelenting in its mission to associate activism with criminality.

This article was taken from the development blog for CAUSE: the social network for activist. Read the article on our [website](https://www.cause.cx/post/activists-are-criminals-introducing-the-legislation-designed-to-undermine-our-rights), and join the growing activist movement, [here](https://www.cause.cx/).

These developments sit as a Governmental response to the growing discontentment with their handling of the cost of living crisis. Proposed strike action will now bring the UK to the edge of a[ *de facto* general strike](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11648793/Rishi-Sunak-demands-Labours-Keir-Starmer-backs-anti-strike-laws-ahead-looming-general-strike.html). While public support for collective action[ holds strong](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/14/most-uk-voters-still-back-strikes-by-nurses-and-ambulance-crews), ten days ago Prime Minister Rishi Sunak proposed new anti-strike legislation, which seeks to diminish the power of trade unions and degrade the confidence of members to engage in direct action. The[ Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3396) joins the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act and proposed Public Order Bill as the latest move in an apparently coordinated strategy by the current Government to undermine the right to peaceful assembly as a whole and degrade public confidence in and perception over the right to protest.

# Rights Under Attack

A cost of living crisis emerged in early 2022 as the disparity between historical wage growth and inflation rates grew. The crisis has motivated unions, across the UK, to mobilise their members for collective action. Yet action over the crisis is not limited to the work of unions; climate justice, anti-discrimination and other political and social pressure groups have connected the cost of living crisis to[ deeper institutional problems](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/05/thousands-expected-attend-london-rally-demand-general-election-peoples-assembly-cost-living-crisis).

&#x200B;

[Unions are rallying their members to strike \(Nick Efford\)](https://preview.redd.it/65r47c7eumda1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e856fe226bc97b753f3ebe63fb7c6529c2bbcf15)

There is a swelling of activity around the cost of living crisis, and the inaction of Government to respond to union demands for fairer pay. Unionised strike action is instead set within a legislative agenda that challenges the very heart of their power: the legal mechanisms that allow unions to engage in collective action and protect their members from undue judicial pressure. These challenges are not just an affront to a just system of democratic checks and balances, but more broadly serves to destabilise the entire character of democratic, activist rights in the UK.

The recently-proposed Anti-Strikes Bill seeks to undermine unions' ability to organise and mobilise their members for collective action. The Bill, if passed, would allow Ministers to write *ad hoc* regulations to force some workers to ignore strike actions, cross picket lines and turn up to work. It would be within the rights of employers to sack employees that do not comply with these regulations, and unions themselves could face huge fines if their members do not comply with Government demands.

The Bill is intended to divide unions, and attack the confidence of workers in their ability to demand change. By threatening unions with huge fines for the actions of members, the Bill's measures intend to disincentive union leaders to even suggest strike action to their members. But, perhaps more concerning, the Bill proposes to undermine the confidence of *all* trade union members by applying monumental legal scrutiny to individual workers. The Bill undermines the essential character of the[ human right to peaceful assembly](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights): that individuals are afforded a basic legal protection to engage in collective action. Those in power must deal with popular movements by addressing their collective demands, not by using the organs of State to apply pressure to individuals themselves. By applying legal pressure to individuals, workers are brought out of wider movements and into positions of exposed public scrutiny: suddenly, union members are forced to decide whether to preserve their jobs and livelihoods or defend the unity of their movements. Change cannot come at the ransom of lost livelihood.

# Activists Are Criminals

The Anti-Strikes Bill fits within a larger legislative strategy that seeks to associate activism with criminality. A programme of legislation is being carefully pushed through Parliament, and it seeks to turn activism over into the grey areas of legality and cast activists into the fringes of society. The 'Policing Act', now enshrined in law, has laid the foundations for the increasingly 'grey' area of law activism now inhabits.

Despite criticism from[ three former Prime Ministers, over seven hundred academics, and three hundred and fifty charities](https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/issue/the-policing-bill-what-happened-and-what-now/), the controversial Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act was eventually passed into law late last year. The law gives the police the power to shut down protests deemed too disruptive. Among other definitions of disruption, a protest can now become illegal if it is judged by the[ police to be too noisy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/circular-0052022-police-crime-sentencing-and-courts-act-2022/circular-0052022-police-crime-sentencing-and-courts-act-2022).

The Act received criticism from many organisations for placing restrictions and parameters on the right to freedom of assembly. A[ briefing published by a large coalition of charities and NGOs](https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Joint-Briefing-on-Pt.-3-PCSCB-Ping-Pong-February-2022a.pdf) highlighted that ""noise stands at the heart of protest. Making noise is how we, quite literally, make our voices heard by those in power"".

Many of the more draconian measures, originally thrown out of the Policing Act as it passed through Parliament, have now made a resurgence in the proposed Public Order Bill. Following months of protests, the Bill's stated aim is to minimise public disruption. But much of the Bill focuses on criminalising individual acts of protest: locking on and glueing, in particular.

&#x200B;

[The House of Lords threw out some of the Policing Bill's more draconian measures](https://preview.redd.it/m9uhxm5cumda1.jpg?width=275&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=13f1b75066f9ffa482300662ab99679790b6f82c)

Whether the Public Order and Anti-Strike Bills are passed, long-term and significant harm has already been dealt to our right to assemble and call for change. It is not immediately a legal harm, although this will surely follow. Instead, it is a harm to confidence and perception.

A powerful anti-activist narrative is already in development: it is not a legal narrative, but an emotive one. Activists are criminals. By associating activism with criminality in proposed legislation, the focus of political discussion is – whether passed or not – is firmly fixed on a harmful association of activism with criminality. This association serves to degenerate activism and activists, and to draw people away from direct action in general.

The political machine's discussion of activism serves to confuse and obfuscate citizens' relationship to the right to protest. Suddenly, we are all forced to consider whether the peaceful protest we might attend is even legal? Or whether the volume of my chanting could result in a criminal record?

This legislative agenda chips away at not just the right to protest, but the source from which the power of direct action is derived: confident, passionate, engaged participants. By pursuing a narrative that seeks to cast activists as criminals, this legislative agenda seeks to undermine the very source of people-power: confidence.

z11o8e,socialism,Perspectives of socialism under the threat of societal collapse,Ramesses02,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/z11o8e/perspectives_of_socialism_under_the_threat_of/,"I assume pretty much everyone here is keenly aware of the impending crisis, which will very likely happen due to a number of reasons - mainly climate change, but potentially resource peaks and the well expected shortfalls of capitalism, and that very possibly will lead to global society collapse. Not to humanity's demise, but certainly to a complete, radical change of how those that survive interact with each other and the world.

Traditional Marxist doctrine states that socialism arises as the next step of capitalism, after it is destroyed by its own contradictions. ML, Maoism and other Marxian branches of socialism include dialectical materialism into conditions other than mature capitalism in other to adapt to the specific socioeconomic conditions, but all of them require an existing state to transition, and assume a certain degree of advancement and industrialization.

Of course nobody exactly knows what ecological collapse entails, but a lot of literature, both from the IPCC and other sources, expect limits to what society can sustain even under heavy ""degrowth"" policies - if peak oil theories are to be believed (and there is substantial evidence for them), there is very, very little chance of being able to sustain an industrial model into the future, which in the end is required for most Marxian strains of socialism.

The thing is that this collapse is not capitalism destroying itself due to its own social contradictions - capitalism is killing itself through external factors before it can become sufficiently centralized, and it is dragging everything else with it along with the resources to build proper, large scale communism, thus it is very likely that society will collapse upon itself way before any proper class consciousness can be formed - moreover, as communication breaks and ecological immigration becomes more prevalent, it would not surprise me if fascistic movements start to become more and more prevalent. It does not seem at all that the proper conditions for traditional Marxist socialism will actually happen. As such, new alternatives that take the material reality that societal transformation may come forced by external agents may have to be taken into account.

I roughly consider myself an ecosocialist - I don't make a value judgement on which doctrine is best - I do believe that left-anarchism has its merits, and its anti-authoritarian nature is appealing, and Marxism also has compelling arguments, with the later potentially being more prosperous, resistant, and sensible when under threat of suppression from capitalism, but also relying more on a post-industrial model of production that, as collapse approaches, feels more and more unlikely. Left-anarchism, although less scalable, feels more resilient in the face of climate change and resource peaks, as it tends to aim for local self-sufficiency (and there are several current day examples of such self-sufficient communes) - so it seems like a better choice of system for a post-collapse scenario - especially as it seems capable of creating sustainable cells even within capitalism. Indeed, a lot of degrowth policies and approaches do tend to favour mutual aid approaches to health, food and education, rather than that of centrally planned economies.

On the other side, it is very clear that left-anarchism and isolationistic degrowth models, without industrial scale production, are very, very likely to not be able to sustain current world's population, not to mention standards of living anywhere near the level advanced economies currently have - just in food, the estimation is that we waste about 1/3 of our food, but without oil based pesticides and fertilizers, our food production would top at around 20% to 50% of our current capacity - this implicitly means that even in the best conditions of food distribution, we would not be able to feed most of our current population.

All in all, I do feel that necessarily ecological collapse will lead to decentralized systems of production - reduction of liveable environment, reduced productivity of food and water supplies, and loss of rich energy sources for transportation and communication will make incredibly hard to realize global level economies.

What's your take? Do you believe traditional Marxist literature still holds? Do you believe that we can maintain the idea of a socialist post-scarcity society under the threat of ecological collapse? Maybe you have an alternative point of view? Or maybe I'm just extremely negative?",74,16,1669044372.0

Its lengthy but I'd like any comments, good bad or downright nasty if youre so inclined\*\*\*

&#x200B;

I am a proletarian from the Canadian province of Ontario. I am the ancestor of proletarians who sold their labour to a capitalist class. I did not choose to be born. I did not choose where to be born, or under what economic circumstances have led to who I am today, and the society I inhabit at this present moment. 

But today I choose to do something. I choose to consider a different allocation of Earth's scarce resources. I choose to consider the material reality of my situation and seek to shift that allocation towards the majority interests of our species, not towards a minority of our species. 

We have a shortage of trained workers in our society because capitalism does not drive society towards meeting the demands of its majority. It is beholden to the superfluous profit motive and monetary system, and those forces ultimately dictate what labour is valued and therefore trained and sought after by the majority out of necessity. If we were beholden to a different motive, labour would be empowered to find fulfilment in training to fill a need of society, one dictated to the benefit of the majority, whom we are all a part of.

We are animals and animals work together to live their lives. We must associate and converge as one species. We. Are. All. Human. Your skin colour, your language, your mode of life, how you've been modelled as a result of the culture that exists due to the relationship of your people with the Earth, how they manage their resources. Humans have evolved beyond simple agrarian life, and are in a whole other state of our evolution. All humans are connected now. We become ever more connected every day.

 But we interact with the Other through competition. 

We all touch each other in some way in this life. How many human hands, labour, will go into adding value to inputs like land and natural resources? I am amazed at how interconnected we are but how distant we are at the same time. We, humans, consume products which have received their added value through the work of fellow workers, even all the way across the world. I had gum made in Spain the other day, Spain! I am typing on a computer made in Taiwan, with a Samsung phone and an Asus monitor. Desk from Ikea, other shit from who knows where probably mostly countries where labour is ""cheaper"" in the capitalist sense. Labour is the most valuable resource of them all because it's We who provide the added value to Earth's bounty. 

Why do we toil at the command and whim of a dispossessed class of megalomaniac Inheritors and Oligarchs of this now outdated capitalist economic mode, who have served their purpose in expanding the productive capabilities of humanity as much as it can? 

A species that forever competes amongst itself is doomed to destruction, but a species that forever associates has infinite potential. It is now time for the workers, the proletariat, the majority of humanity, to take control of the very capital that our and our proletarian ancestor's blood, sweat, and tears have utilized and use it to our benefit. Now that we have the ability to produce enough for everyone, even when the resource is organized in the toxic capitalist mode of competition, why the fuck don't we?

 Imagine what we can do for everyone if we organized our resources towards the common benefit of all Humanity. None would be excluded, but those who are against it will be convinced otherwise. Harmony with the Other has always guided humans together, and it will continue to guide us towards a greater future. We must find solidarity in the fact we are all human. We are all made of the same stuff, the stuff of the universe. We are literally composed of stuff that has existed for billions of years, maybe more. There is so much exciting stuff to discover about Humanity as a species, and the universe, but we will not come to understand it until we set aside competition and embrace association. Think of how cool archaeology is going to be once we discover more about our much deeper human prehistory.

&#x200B;

So what is something so strong that it, along with proper guidance, pushes man towards a collective allocation of Earth's resources towards minimizing humanity's social welfare loss?

&#x200B;

The following is from the Wiki regarding the Cretaceous extinction event. 

""As originally proposed in 1980\[6\] by a team of scientists led by Luis Alvarez and his son Walter, it is now generally thought that the K–Pg extinction was caused by the impact of a massive asteroid 10 to 15 km (6 to 9 mi) wide,\[7\]\[8\] 66 million years ago, which devastated the global environment, mainly through a lingering impact winter which halted photosynthesis in plants and plankton.\[9\]\[10\] The impact hypothesis, also known as the Alvarez hypothesis, was bolstered by the discovery of the 180 km (112 mi) Chicxulub crater in the Gulf of Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula in the early 1990s,\[11\] which provided conclusive evidence that the K–Pg boundary clay represented debris from an asteroid impact.\[12\] The fact that the extinctions occurred simultaneously provides strong evidence that they were caused by the asteroid.\[12\] A 2016 drilling project into the Chicxulub peak ring confirmed that the peak ring comprised granite ejected within minutes from deep in the earth, but contained hardly any gypsum, the usual sulfate-containing sea floor rock in the region: the gypsum would have vaporized and dispersed as an aerosol into the atmosphere, causing longer-term effects on the climate and food chain. In October 2019, researchers reported that the event rapidly acidified the oceans, producing ecological collapse and, in this way as well, produced long-lasting effects on the climate, and accordingly was a key reason for the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous.\[13\]\[14\]""

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene\_extinction\_event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_extinction_event)

&#x200B;

This was the dinosaur killer, but because impacts more or less leave similar traces, we know there was something going on around the end of the last ice age. The 10,800 BCE impacts weren't as bad as this one, but impact winter still resulted. Impacts cause stratospheric dust, which reflects the sun and thus no sun heats the earth and shit gets cold. 

&#x200B;

So we have floods, ice cap rupture, apocalyptic fire and things destroying man from the sky, comet fragments from the Taurid stream, likely a broken stream of comet fragments just doing their thing with gravity, just as the Earth is doing. Remember that large extraterrestrial impact in Russia a few years ago? We humans are blessed with the foresight of knowing what the fucks up. And I think our ancient ancestors also knew what the fuck was up, but they couldn't escape. Maybe we can.

&#x200B;

They knew what was happening because they were so clearly and ubiquitously masters of astrology. Is it just a coincidence that so many incredibly ancient structures (12,800 years, even more. 10,000s of thousands of years) with extremely complex architectures were built with perfect astronomy? When you backdate the stars, you can figure out the exact thing they were aiming for, and they built amazing structures over thousands of years, with some in Malta closely tracking the star Sirius, all others having alignments to true north, the equinoxes and solstices, etc. Truly amazing that this was all built BEFORE SUPPOSED HUMAN CIVILIZATION AND PREHISTORY STARTS. 

&#x200B;

It's like the year 4300BC or something agriculture and animal husbandry just appears in Southern Anatolia and spread down to Iraq and the Sumerians start the party, and then just everywhere else around the same time. Wow, early humans really knew their shit and developed super fucking quick, then stagnated for several hundred years or more depending. Just a coincidence, right? Just conveniently ignore all the evidence before that year, which we have now thanks to glorious geology. Carbon-12 don't tell no lies folks. Carbon-12 wants the best for all of us, it wants understanding and solidarity amongst the humans that it also comprises

&#x200B;

SO what's the point of this rant?

&#x200B;

 It's to get you inspired. 

&#x200B;

We humans have a greater history than we allow ourselves to comprehend. As Graham Handcock puts it in his thesis and hypothesis on human prehistory, ""we are a species with amnesia"".

I was truly blown away by the implications of this, and with a geology education background, I can respect and dig more into the science behind it. I also believe its no coincidence all early human civilization cultures built pyramidal structures with eerily similar chamber layouts (Watch the first episode of Ancient Apocalypse on Netflix and tell how both Ancient Egyptians and Ancient Indonesians, two cultures who built these at times datable to thousands years apart, built the same 3 interior chamber style layout megalithic structures. And then watch the whole thing because it is extremely exciting and satisfying to fully comprehend all the evidence). 

When I read Engel's Principles of Communism, I am optimistic. We are in a place to finally leverage the power of Humanity. It is through communism and the power of the internet. The internet will allow us to organize the world's economic resources with already existing enterprise software, expanded to fit the needs of the supranational economy. If Chile was doing it in the 1970's, imagine what information technology could do today, without crippling economic sanctions and being limited to the resources of their national borders. With virtually real-time production data, we can make real-time simulations of how economic decisions will affect our material reality. Those can be leveraged to easily provide ""human rights"" to everyone, so we can focus on what makes us fulfilled, regardless of needing to worry about where we will live, where we'll get food, where we'll find education, where we'll find love. 

I am optimistic. I see societal progress beyond a capitalist, private property-oriented ownership of resources. There is an immense loss of social welfare to appease the personal vanities of the dispossessed humans who comprise the capitalist class, those who have a perverted and dangerous concept of the Other. They see the Other as someone to be exploited. This view will not enable societal progress if that is the view of those who control society and those whose unscrupulous virtues allow them to be okay with exploiting the world for profit to the majority's abject suffering. It is a shame that the system proposes these virtues as the means to be successful in life. 

Why do we compete, when it is human nature to associate? It is our destiny to associate. It is only in this association that humanity can hope to cross the stars, and spare our future generations the catastrophic and apocalyptic end that is ever so more a reality. Such a terrible event that such great lengths were gone to rebuild civilization and many warnings were left behind, potentially all linked to this very event. A warning of what's to come?

I don't want my future folk to find out

The discovery of this can be the rallying cry for communism with a focus on the survival of humanity, through the greatness of humanity.

What can connect us all? What is something that every proletarian relates to so strongly that it can influence the organization of labour so the earth's resources can be leveraged to the benefit of every human? 

Ontario's north will not be developed until it becomes profitable for the capitalist. It will become profitable once said capitalists are done raping another group of worker's resources away from their land, leaving it uninhabitable and robbed of the very thing that the modern world provided them by sheer collective chance that they were born there.

 A true utilization of Ontario's glorious labour would mean the development and intensification of developing land up north. It is only through this drive that Ontario will bring about prosperity and ensure a good quality of life to all the hands and mouths and minds that make it possible. It will enable us to assist our fellow proletarian brothers around the world when the climate crisis gets worse, and they are ultimately displaced due to flooding. 

We are at a critical juncture and we have to do fuuuuucking something people so let's think of a new ideology that EVERYONE can get behind. Realize you are the Other. I am the Other. We are all the Other. Use this precept in your interactions with your fellow humans. Everyone wants to form a connection. True emotional connection with other people is truly what it means to be human. Whether that be through good friends, family, children, or anyone. The beauty of it is we can all form that connection because we're all human. 

When enabled and given the chance, Man does help Man. That is because Man is an animal, and our evolution as a species can not be limited in definition to our biological makeup. We are the only species here that are capable of evolving how we interact and view one another, and how we frame our perceptions of the Other in our everyday life. Our modes of production and relation to resources have been healthier in the past. Hunter gatherers live a simple life, and some folk still do today. But the rest of us have gotten to this point in history with great human suffering for those who came before. At what point do We inherit the earth?

We must cast away the old forms of economic organization that have enabled human progress at the condition that the majority of humans suffer and are stifled in fulfilling their greatest potential 

We know this can be done. We just need to do it

We add the fucking value. So now we will take that value. 

The solution will not be one that involves the reform of inherently flawed systems of economic resource distribution. Our economic distribution and our human relationship to the factors of production and resources, in general, have been guided by a capitalist economic theory. Our governments and political system are an undeniable product of this, being almost exclusively composed of the humans in the capitalist class and their cronies. The global banking system and the fact the capitalist class (very small percentage of humans) control it, and ultimately control the resources of the world, are free to make decisions that we have ZERO SAY IN.

They are made by those who control capital resources, those factors of production whereby the collective innovation and ingenuity of millions of humans, the majority, the proletariat, the workers have made possible such products that we can easily organize to feed the whole world's population, even with the socially inefficient allocation of resources we have this year 2022 CE.

(just think about it as a thought experiment. Follow your ""democratic vote"" through to where you'd be able to effect economic change in your workplace, our province, the world. Do we really live in a democracy if we can't control the very thing that dictates whether we'll be able to subsist?)

For Ontario, a government force to build homes to compete with the private sector (A government force in many major industires in fact, but I'm not here to debate that). The government should also levy heavy taxes on these private institutions and of course, they will eventually be snuffed out by the simple forces of supply and demand they have been happily manipulating with the help of private sector capitalist-favouring governments like Doug Ford's. The government of this solution accepts that home ownership is a human right, and will construct homes in a planned manner to best eliminate Ontario's social welfare loss. I believe we live in the perfect province, with the perfect mix of international proletarians, for critical mass towards a political takeover of our government, and a real start towards shifting the Earth's resources away from the few members of the human species that hoard and produce egregious amounts of resources that grossly profit and benefit them, all at the expense and suffering of We, the workers of Ontario

I invite you to do your own research and discover that human nature, indeed animal nature, is to associate and not compete. Given the chance, all humans will seek to help and benefit the Other. They will not choose greed, as they will not be forced to choose unfulfilling and unscrupulous work just to subsist.

It feels good to help another human and have it reciprocated

How our species manages resources now, and how we run our economy now, is extremely out of line with the needs and wants of the majority of our species members.

106g4o5,socialism,Market Rationing,WTFcannuck,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/106g4o5/market_rationing/,"This might be a small thing that has no impact, but I think that we should start using the term “market rationing” more commonly. It’s technically correct, the best kind of correct, it's dispassionate and quickly conveys the immorality of markets when used in certain circumstances.  

“Market rationed water will keep the golf courses green while people die of thirst.”

“Market rationed health care will treat the rich person’s hangnail before the poor person’s cancer.”

“Even the U.S. abandons market rationed food at a certain point with food stamps, canada still relies on food banks.”

“Market rationed housing has hedge funds buying whole neighborhoods while people can't get in at all.”  
 
One of the biggest problems for Socialists is the explanations become too verbose and people tune out. “Market rationing” strips markets of their luster and rightfully puts it down with all the other rationing systems that we have come up with like triage, food stamps etc. Demystifying markets will subtlety expose the sycophancy of liberals to the system. It removes the false freedom that markets claim to give. As climate change gets worse and shortages become more common terms like market rationing will become more potent. Bashing markets first will then make it easier to advocate for decommodification.

What I am talking about is what I think is the biggest danger we humans always faced: what is called “the international anarchic system” (as John Mearsheimer well explained, see linked video if you’d like to know).

Here’s John Mearsheimer:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w09knatXrCk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w09knatXrCk)

To explain it basically, “the international anarchic system” means that there isn’t any other power above that of nations, that may arbitrate and avoid conflict: that is, if several nations compete for power, a confrontation will usually happen.

That is what happened in the two world wars, when dominant powers collided against emerging ones.

Now we have a new collision coming: China and the US. The US had unchallenged power, but this is the case no more, as China is expected to equal the US within ten to twenty years.  And they have some old bitter economic and territorial rivalries, mostly in the coast of China, that will inevitably lead to conflict if we don’t do something.

If socialism came to power in a group of developed countries, such as the US, Germany and the UK (just to give an example.  I'm a Spaniard living in the UK). It would very probably conjure up enough force, by joining forces with existing socialist countries like China, Cuba, etc. to indisputably convert competition amongst powers, into the exact opposite: collaboration. Countries wouldn’t need powerful armies, and the real main challenges of humankind: the distribution of resources, the eradication of mass disease, elimination of crippling inequality, climate change, mass education and opportunities for all of us, may come to an end. The more so because we would be aided by the advances in technology, the technology revolution coming, that is making our lives so much easier.

Otherwise, if socialism fails and we get stuck with the current competitive nationalized world, all we can expect is more of the same, what capitalism, confrontation and greed has always given us: war and grief.

Will it really take something as drastic and dramatic as horse people to get a locality, let alone a nation, to overthrow capitalist chains? I can tell you right now that the time the industrial periphery turns socialist the world will have already ended. What with climate change and wars and needless corporate waste and slave labor use and on and on the atrocities go. I don't want to sound like some doomer, I just can't help it. Being a socialist in the imperial core sucks. 

I'm slowly making my way through Parenti, excellent author but for my own mental health I can only take a heavy topic in small doses. As short as Parenti can be it keeps to the point very well and is absolutely packed with mind blowing information. Just for that I'm grateful for his works. At the same time, I can read theory, reality, history, etc all I want, but it feels like organizing anything, let alone a dual power system, seems impossible. Especially in the USA. Living in the South doesn't help, as every other pickup has a thin blue line or MAGA sticker on it. Even if I talk with the neighbors they're disillusioned middle class suburbanites who are center right at best. I can try and mask my views as much as I'd like. Say some bs about supporting a ""democratic economy"" but I can only beat around the bush so much until I can only say I'm an out and out socialist and point out to Susan that each and every policy she supports has a socialist base and all they will hear is ""commie"" 

I work myself up in energy for doing *something,* anything to help my community's situation. But we haven't starved enough to care apparently. We see the brief headline of delivery drivers suffering in the heat. We see the reports of amazon workers walking over *corpses* because Bezos wants another penny. About how Starbucks would rather shut down store locations than treat their workers with dignity. I see all of this and I want to help. The things that get in my way is my goddamn 4/10 schedule, which beats me to a pulp as I work in a trade. I need at least 1 day to decompress and have some kind of fun and stay sane, then another day to spend time with my partner as that's important to me, and Sunday is in total preparation for the week. 

I'm making $15/hr and it's STILL not enough. I cannot sustain myself and my partner and start a family on $15 wage. Sure, I upgraded from starvation wages to poverty wages but I'm still living in my partner's parent's house, I'm still trying to find something affordable that doesn't exist, I'm trying to squirrel away a few dollars for emergencies, and I have to turn around and console myself and my partner about the general living situation that absolutely sucks. 

I've joined and left the DSA after a few months because they acted very culty before I left. I bring up valid issues with the chapter and they sweep my concern under the rug, pat themselves on the back to keep an illusion up, turn around and ridicule me for ""bashing on other people's work"" when that wasn't where I was coming from nor intended. They then tried to gaslight me, lovebomb me, offer a position of power, then have the audacity to talk about their issues which have nothing to do with growing the party, running candidates, performing direct action. The DSA in SC is a goddamn joke and I'm appalled that this is the best ""alternative"" we got besides the democrats. 

I've even reached out to the Socialist Alternative. I've read their website and I really believe they're a good party to join. Very classic socialist party with solid ideas to push. I reached out and haven't had a reply for a week and a half. I pledged what I can and I am totally willing to do the work for starting a chapter in this state because as I've said, I need an outlet for this energy besides raving and foaming at the mouth on reddit. 

Fuck me this whole bit feels so hopeless. I don't want to have kids in this world! I don't want to see my family suffer anymore! I don't want to suffer anymore! I want to see heads roll, flags waved, I want everyone to have some stability in their life; I want to see a roof over every head, food on every table, clean tap water in every sink. I want everyone to be paid properly for their work. I don't want to see a single starving child anymore in this gods forsaken country. I don't want anymore teenagers going to prison for pushing drugs. I want to see my sibling be the wonderful artist they are, not living a miserable life working at fucking Dunkin'. Where is the justice in this country? Where is the wealth? Where is the fire of action we all want? Is it not enough that children are starving? That we have *millions* of homeless.

x3uhvq,socialism,I did a eco-socialist speech at work!,De_wasbeer,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/x3uhvq/i_did_a_ecosocialist_speech_at_work/,"Hi all.

My name is Johan. I'm a lecturer/professor renewable energy engineering and project lead in development in an energy transition lab at the university I work at.

I'd like to share this story just because I took some personal pride in being asked to do a speech for a bunch of important folks. For years I've worked behind the curtains on an energy transition program for the uni I work at. Lately we made some good milestones that placed me in the foreground of this project. I'm starting to be able to get a proper voice in the uni I work at, which opens up wonderful possibilities to create an energy transition program that is free to attend for 'regular' people.

I was asked to write a speech for the year opening of my university. This was no regular event but a closed meeting where all directors of my uni, mayor of the city and big players in the industry attended (200 people total).

Of course it was pretty frightening to do, never done something like this. I took my chance to go full eco-socialist, even closed the meeting with a quote from Marx.

And the fun side, I got loud applause!

If anyone is interested I've put my speech in google translate and translated it to English.

*What will be in the history books about us in 100 years?*

*You are probably thinking of Corona and the war in Ukraine. But these events pale in comparison to the looming consequences of climate change. If we continue like this, our generation will go down in the books as one that didn't act in time to prevent the climate catastrophe.*

*For a few months now, we have all been able to taste the bitter taste of this dystopian future for the first time at our home at the table. In addition to all the suffering in Ukraine, the terrible war with Russia has also had a major impact on the (country). We have even coined a new word for it: 'Energy Poverty'.*

*And if even we, the high middle class of (city), experience the consequences of energy poverty, what about our fellow human beings who have not had the opportunities we have been given?*

*Let's face it, there have to be drastic changes in our society. We in this room are the future of (city), we are at the helm of the future of this city. We have the responsibility to determine the course of the energy transition in our city.*

*The energy transition is the greatest challenge we as humanity have ever faced. But in addition to a doomsday scenario, let us also see it as a great opportunity to lay the foundations of our new society together. A society where we do not see ourselves, but the symbiosis between people, animals and nature as the most important success factor.*

*But we can only be successful if everyone really changes their mentality. And by this I don't just mean the engineers, policy makers and the young generation, etc. But especially the people who don't feel addressed by my speech. Everybody! Dear people in the room, we have to break our patterns now, NOW! There is no second earth.*

*Fortunately, there are already quite a few fantastic projects that shape our (city) energy transition. Within my industry, for example, there are the great hydrogen innovations at the port, the water taxi and even at petroleum giant Shell. In addition, we are also the world leader in the installation of offshore wind farms in our region. We are also already seeing the first circular innovations of the new world in our city center in (company), (social program) and the (circular and social housing project).*

*I myself have made it my mission to realize my impact on the energy transition by developing beautiful new education for (city) University. It is my personal mission to motivate as many students and colleagues as possible to contribute to the energy transition.*

*I have been developing the energy transition lab together with colleagues, students and industry for two years now. This living lab is the basis of a new educational program that breaks through the compartmentalization of study programmes, faculties and industries. Everyone has access to learn at the energy transition lab. And by this I mean you too! I hereby invite you to participate and develop the platform together with our team!*

*It's time we all crawl out of our ivory towers and stop being held back by all the bureaucracy, limitations and mental blocks we've imposed on ourselves. It is time for us as a society to regain balance with the needs of our mother earth.*

*We have nothing to lose but our chains, and our gain is the world!*

I apologize if i come off as a show off, I'm just really proud of my achievement, and like to share it with like minded people.",36,12,1662100884.0
y8lrmb,socialism,Socialism Orgs in Toronto - Question,oochmagooch,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/y8lrmb/socialism_orgs_in_toronto_question/,"Question for any Canadian comrades here: what parties/groups are any good? I am in Toronto studying as an internal student (I'm from the US) in Canada and really want to join an explicitly communist/socialist org either now or after I get my citizenship (I also wonder if it will be a problem if I do it before). With that aside The ones I'm aware of are as follows:

1: [Socialist Action Canada](https://socialistaction.ca/)\- I had seen their posters around for a while and I got to meet them in person, as they attended a university protest I was part of that specifically wanted to force the university to change its SA policies -  since they abuse survivors and don't actually do anything about predators etc- and they had set up a little booth. I will say their presence there felt a bit off since they were noticeably older (out of the 4-5 people two were absolutely adults and the other two I have no idea) and carrying flags, sorta apart from the group which felt like they were kinda crashing this small protest but I don't know what went on behind the scenes. The only other things worth noting is that they seem to be Trotskyists and in their [Municipal Socialist Alliance](https://municipal.socialistalliance.ca/) platform they are advancing they advocate eliminating taxes on small businesses (somewhat suspicious). They also support joining the NDP social caucus so they may be essentially one org but I don't want to jump the gun. All that said they seem to be the most active in the community so I currently am leaning their way.

2: [The Socialist Party of Canada (WSM)](https://canadasocialistparty.ca/) \- I think I may have seen some members during a protest for action against climate change but I can't quite remember. And I do know that they put up posters at least last year. I just don't know a ton about them. One red flag is that I wanted to link their website here and it isn't working...

3: [The Communist Party of Canada](https://communist-party.ca/)\- I have seen their posters more last year but this year too. I can't say much else really I don't think I've seen them in person.

4: [The NDP Socialist Caucus](https://ndpsocialists.ca/) \- A wing of the NDP, or New Democratic Party, (which everybody agrees is not a socialist party) that wishes to transform it into a proletarian party. The obvious strength is that the NDP is a fairly large party, and does have some serious swing. They are also supported by the aforementioned Socialist Action Canada.

5: [Fightback](https://www.marxist.ca/) \- the Canadian wing of the International Marxist Tendency (Trotskyist). Although technically a publication/newsletter I have seen a number of events they've hosted and they put posters around. I can say with confidence they are active.

Hopefully, I didn't miss any and I don't want to cause fighting over which groups yall like I am just trying to shield myself from big mistakes. I know Canada may be different but at least in the US many socialist parties kinda blow at least on the national level. Thanks in advance :)",6,5,1666232905.0
xqq8j8,socialism,my thought at Iranian protest as an Iranian.,SultanamSultan,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/xqq8j8/my_thought_at_iranian_protest_as_an_iranian/,"I've seen many many different responses from leftist to these protest and I would like to explain my position as well.



We are in a historic era, even western geopoliticalist know that the shift from a unipolar world to a multipolar is happening, this shift would make the world unstable for at least a decade, protests would form in everywhere and in every block, these are natural in the next 10 years.


I'm against Mandatory hijab, but one thing is certain, the rule was supported by a majority until at least 10 years ago, for the majority of its existence it was supported by most people. The protest started with accusations that she was beaten to death, the government showed a video of her collapsing due to stress and not getting beaten( she was walking perfectly and unless you want to dismiss the video as fake you can't say she was beaten with no proof other than a tweet.) but by then it was already late.


USA invovlment in these protest is adding fuel to a fire, but they weren't the one lighting the match, this was absolutely IRI fault.


Every protest in Iran gets hijacked by various groups and a simple non violent protest with a specific means to it gets hijacked by separatists and overthrowners (that's the name of people that want the Islamic Republic gone at any cost, usually monarchies and liberals).


IRI absolutely loves this because it allows them to convince their supporters that these protests are invalid and illegitimate. USA loves this too because it can put a propaganda campaign on how Iranian wants a revolution. 

There are both rioters and actual protesters in these protests.



Lots of fake news about the army joining people, cities falling to protesters and high command leaving Iran were coming out and all of these usually comes out from Western sources to give some people hope that a revolution is happening everywhere and they should come out if they want to be a part of it, of course this isn't a revolution but western media loves too make this way bigger than it actually is and make it as long as possible. 


A faction of Iranian protesters called reformist which are usually liberals and want social change too were always happy to join the USA world order and wanted it so bad they helped America in its adventure in Afghanistan and Iraq and everytime they got cucked by America, 1992, 2002, and 2015 with JCPOA, everytime USA has made them look like clowns because it constantly betray them, USA is partly responsible for Iran hardline conservatives becoming the dominant faction, because ironically they have a better understanding about imprelism than these liberals. 




The crocodile tear the western crowd is shedding is nothing but disrespectful to Iranians, Sanctions have made our life so much worse than these rules which were popular in a different time and climate and now they aren't. I can tell you that 99% of these protesters anger was charging because of economic problems and not social ones, the stress we put on when we are seeing higher and higher prices is nothing compared to the stress a woman gets when a morality police is around, which are now almost extinct but the government keeps a few thousands around just to keep its supporters happy, they are way less common to find than 10 years ago.




If you are a western leftist just know that while the government has its long listed of issues, it is much more better than a western backed monarch and that is the best scenario, in the worse scenario we would become another Syria or Libya if USA interferes with the protest due to having high support from its people because of these recent propaganda campaign. 



Sanctions and embargos damages to the country are nothing like our internal issues, when a country losses its half of revenue it will be more and more unstable, the worst is over for us, The situation will get better in the next couple of years because frankly there is no other Sanctions they could inforce.",11,7,1664403556.0

wz37x4,socialism,Trends in Power Distribution: Why Socialism is our Destiny,schlurp23,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/wz37x4/trends_in_power_distribution_why_socialism_is_our/,"Hi, I thought that this may be a good place to share this. As described in the first paragraph, I usually try not to approach this topic using the proper wording, as it bothers me that every discussion turns totally irrational once one of these words are mentioned. So this is a common approach for me to discuss the topic and I thought it may be worth sharing. Feedback is highly appreciated, positive or negative! ;)

**Context**

In public debate, usage of the word “socialism” usually leads to an instant decay of the principal rules of logic and discussion. Only few words exist, where the range of conceptions, associations and emotions is so vast, beyond the simple principle that is technically covered by its definition. The majority of phrases commonly blurted out in response and socially agreed upon as valid arguments are merely based on a multitude of additional assumptions, invalid implications or ill distinction between correlation and causality. This is understandable, given the fact that the world has been divided over many decades, and the word “socialism”, among other words, represented a pivotal propaganda term on both sides.  

I thus want to take a step back from this word and elaborate a concept that, I hope, many people may agree with, despite potential biases regarding the expressions that would rightfully fit the elaborated sub-concepts. My aim is to state clear definitions for the central terms in these conceptions, restricting the discussion to the principal rules of logic, instead of letting it drift off into the ill-constrained space of association and ideology.

**Power**

A central aspect in the presented concept is power, in the following defined as the ability of an individual or collective, to directly or indirectly affect the lives of other humans. Power can be subdivided into political or institutional power, spiritual or opinion-forming power, and economic power. Note, that the descriptions of types of power are not judgmental in any way, but simply describe common principles of influence between individuals or collectives.

*Political power* describes the control of an institution that comprises the monopoly on the use of force, e.g. a police or military force. If an individual refuses to obey the institutional rules, a well trained, organized and equipped force is deployed to sanction the individual. This applies to all political systems, their difference merely lies in the design of rules, or laws, that apply to individuals as well as the determination of who can design rules in the first place and thus inherits the power.

*Spiritual, or opinion-forming power* applies e.g. to religions. Individuals or collectives in central positions of religious communities can strongly affect other people’s lives by altering some people’s belief and ethical systems. Other examples can be thought of, but for the sake of simplicity, spiritual power is not part of the following elaboration and is only mentioned here for completeness.

At last, *economic power* can relatively simply be summarized as capital. Examples for the direct and indirect effects on other human lives are as manifold as they are perspicuous. They include the alternation of environments, exposure to certain threads and health risks, or the development and supply with various goods, e.g. advanced medicine.

**Trends in the distribution of power throughout human history**

*Political power*

In the past, large distances between groups of humans and limitations regarding the ability to cover such, strongly limited the “area of effect” and thus overall power that an individual or collective could have. Over time, population growth as well as developments and advancements in infrastructure, communication, distribution of labor, social orders and many other factors continuously increased this maximum of feasibly exercisable power.  

Within this upper boundary, distribution of political power in human history shows a very clear and impressive trend towards temporal concentration. The history of societies on large land masses is in great parts one of consecutive empires, massing institutional power in the hands of few, as much political power massively increases the options of an individual or collective to gain even more. This is, until the upper boundary is reached, determined by the current limiting factor among the previously mentioned development markers.

Through development of societies, this upper boundary is elevated, regarding e.g. the number of people subjected to this power, as well as its overall severity. However, we can observe an additional, interfering trend in opposite direction. Equally enabled by certain developments in societies including division of labor, political philosophy and education, or individual awareness of large-scale political, economic and societal circumstances, a desire for a more directed and even distribution of institutional power emerged. 

Opposing the seemingly natural concentration of political power, however, proved to be an immensely difficult challenge. While principal participation in early “democracies” was reserved to those who already had some decent power (lands and slaves) in the first place, such attempts of directed power distributions failed over and over. Outperformed by monarchic competitors (e.g. Greek city states) or deconstructed by individuals that knew how to abuse flaws or insufficiently matched preconditions to deconstruct the complex political system and concentrate political power among a much smaller group (e.g. Roman emperors, or Germany’s Weimarer Republik in the 1930s).

But none of these setbacks halted the general trend to a directed, socially agreed on distribution of political power. More and more complex systems, requiring more and more developmental preconditions to be matched, emerged. The increase in complexity of these organizing systems is very impressive, regarding that the majority of very early societies had but one rule, demanding full obedience from a single, god-like ruler, while complex, interacting rules of current societies including checks and balances for individuals in relevant positions fill countless books and are, or should be, subject to constant refinement.

*Economic power*

Many of the principles associated with political power equally apply to economic power. Without doubt, economic power, if unchecked, equally tends to be concentrated, an issue that we become more and more aware of in recent times. Without doubt, people massively suffer from a lack of economic power, often in a much more general and life-threatening way than from the lack of political power. The developments that expand the space of possibilities to create complex systems for the directed distribution of political power, do the same for economic power distribution. 

Similarly, although at later times, advances in political philosophy and better understanding of the current circumstances triggered the desire to submit the distribution of economic power to a system that we define and control through social consensus. Just like the early attempts of democracy, the majority of such attempts arguably failed in early stages as a result of unmatched preconditions, outside competitors or initial flaws that allowed the deconstruction or abuse of the complex system for accumulation of both political and economic power.  

In contrast to political systems, however, we have – in public discussions – accepted these setbacks as final, disregarding the incredible advances that we have made since. These advances include wide-spread political and economic education, an extremely efficient infrastructure and communication system, enhancements in data collection, storage and processing by many orders of magnitude and immense quantities of knowledge and expertise, available for everyone at any location and time.  

Instead, we subdue ourselves to a system that, if named after political systems, could only be described as anarchy, claiming that any direct involvement in the national or global streams of capital poses a severe danger of societal decay and chaos. As if the consequences of our economic interactions were god-given, we cling to the belief that growth and innovation will somehow fix everything, or simply blame the replaceable collectives or individuals that happened to fall into the role of great accumulators.

**Consensus**

The global destruction of ecosystems, the climate crisis and the depletion of resources that keep our society and every life dependent on it running, are only few examples of how badly we have lost control. We regard consequences of competition between individuals, companies or nations as unavoidable, and in our current system, they certainly are. Rapid growth and exploitation are intrinsic in it and it is – at the least – a dangerous gamble to believe that this chaotic system driven by individual accumulation of capital will somehow solve all the time-sensitive issues that it has created.  

If we want to gain control, we need to democratize economic power in the same way, as we at least partly democratized political power. Both processes are, and will always be a constant struggle against the desires of individuals to undermine the individual implementations in order to enforce their own agenda at the potential cost of human life and dignity. Such systems will always need to be adapted and complexed to match the threats and possibilities emerging from changed circumstances or new developments. But given the breathtaking achievements that various groups of humans, small or large, dedicated to their cause have gained, it is hard to believe that this is just not possible.

TL;DR I rant and rave about solidarity and pressing forth regardless of dissent within the left, and specify that there will be relentless challenges but that should never deter us from pursuing a better world.


The original comment thread:  https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/vrymmb/the_big_one_moore_v_harper_scotus_case_will_make/iey2mts?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3

But specifically this: ""It's hard to say, a capitalist world without the US is still a capitalist world. There's still plenty of countries willing to bomb in capitalist wars.""

And the actual thing I want to post and hold discussion over:

I concur that its difficult to predict, but at the same time, the only nations with similarly scaled military programs are...who? Russia and China by numbers, maybe the UK, France, Australia, and the NATO crew will try to pull US military in to keep the ""Global Freedom Army"", or maybe without the fear of US, China will turn on their already shaky relations with Russia for being too imperialistic. Then theres the question of the people that do remain in a post ""2nd civil war"" US and its victors. Would it fracture into 2, 3, or even 17 different nations? If there is a split, how will the leftist militants, right militias, and former federal military act? Where will they divi up to? Who goes where, and how much brute force do they have. Furthermore, could a theocratic dictatorship ""grift"" (and i use this word lightly here) standing US allies/NATO into combat on US soil the seceded in order to ""Liberate the people of West Washington State from the their new communist overlords"". These options alone could all play out, or none. The scariest part to me is not gov changing, its how the people will act that fall for the return McCarthyism. My worries culminate on how many concentration camps get built for leftists, for people of asian descent because ""china bad"" and the ""chinavirus"", for the peaceful muslims, JWs, catholics, especially the Jewish, and even more so the non-judeo-christian believers and atheists. Evem assuming a leftist revolution takes hold, the far right will remain somewhere under the guise of constitutionalists. I have so many more and I guarantee there are others with scarier thoughts than I have. However, I also stand that we don't have a choice if we want to have even the slightest chance have halting climate change before it brings the end of another archeological era. If we want to see true equality amongst humans, and our partnership to the rest of life respected. We must work to form a coalition which can tolerate new developments, both for and against the cause, that spans not just North America, but the global south, an alliance between Stalinists and Pan-Africans, between AnComs and Maoists. We can voice and debate these dissents when we have a parliment to discuss them. Until then we must stand in solidarity, no different than that of a the rising worker unions, and in fact we must bring those unions into the coalition. If the liberal does not feel their vote counts, but cannot be swayed, then theire voice must be heard if we are to have their support. I would much rather have the US as it stands today with a Green v Dem government than I would the Christian Nationalist rule of DeSantis we are headed for. So be it if Brazil or South Africa wishes to wage war in name of profit. We must put on our own oxygen mask first. After the first deep breath we can share it.


I apologize that this was long, and that it veered off topic a bit, but I generally need to relight the fire for myself about once a week. Hopefully this included a valid addition to the disccussion and that it sparks or fans the flame for someone else.


I didn't end up posting this in that thread as I felt it was too off topic, but i do feel its necessary to put ourselves under review once in awhile. Find your fears and walk through with what can be done. Despite hownlovely our glistening ideals may be, they won't fit everyone and we will always be required to work within the material world. Most of my quarrels inside this community is the large amount of outright hatred for CPC and sometimes China as whole - I'm not arguing for or against them, I live in the US and cannot speak/read anything other than English, so I know the propaganda is off the wall in all directions here. What I do know is that they remain a stronger economy than the western world, and the few other nations that stand truly leftist are very small. And please please **correct me if I'm wrong**, but Marx showed that capitalism is the predecessor to socialism, which is the predecessor to communism. So if we take the material examples that are not being constantly splayed by media outlets, the chinese economy has grown immensely, is now almost entirely nationalized, and their infrastructure (in the past 15 years) is more stable and built faster than almost anywhere else in the world. A massive change from 60 years ago when the US really picked up on outsourcing. So far they've been the best example economically of the rise of a leftist state. Unless you want an agrarian community, you need to build the infrastructure first, that requires resources. All of this is to say that I believe the US anti-communist propaganda has hit deep. Again, I have never been to China, I am incabale of keeping tabs on their politics in the native tongue, and I am overall accepting of my ignorance on subjects such as the Uyghur and the Falun Gong. But if we are to stand in solidarity, we can listen to the words of a neoliberal (for his time). ""A house divided cannot stand.""

It applied to the first US civil war, and, differently, it applies to us. I couldn't care less if you're anarchist or a tankie, we stand against the landlords and the suits. Duke it out later, we cannot be our own enemies.",20,0,1657049696.0
uqmlwd,socialism,Has the counter-revolutionary period engendered an arrogance in the bourgeois ruling class that could sow the seeds of its own demise?,mausoliam95,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/uqmlwd/has_the_counterrevolutionary_period_engendered_an/,"I think it's well-established that the Russian revolution set the stage for the New Deal reforms of the 1930s and the creation of the welfare state in Western Europe in the 20th century. Pragmatic liberals realized that the only way to forestall revolution was to soften the edges of capitalism's contradictions by improving the standard of living of the average American or European worker, obviously at the expense of the average third world worker. But, after communism collapsed everywhere except Asia and Latin America, the bourgeois world gained the swagger and confidence to further double-down on austerity, hyper-exploitation, and massive police repression. Now that there hasn't been a successful socialist revolution in roughly forty years, the bourgeoisie believes it has won and no longer needs to concede much of anything to the working class, because it no longer feels like revolution is even a remote possibility. 

But in so doing, is the ruling class sowing the seeds of its own demise? Is it leaving itself unprepared for the social unrest that will surely follow as capitalism's contradictions intensify in the era of climate change and increasing global instability? Will it be able to beat back militant left-wing social movements should they arise? Or will it find itself caught off-guard and lose legitimacy? Sure, the American ruling class gave the people some concessions during the onset of COVID-19 and its associated economic calamity, so as to forestall civic unrest, but almost all of those concessions have been rolled back over the last year or so. Bourgeois society is a ticking time bomb, and the elites are choosing to double-down on austerity and hyper-exploitation. Even mild reforms are being jettisoned. As John F. Kennedy said, ""those who make reform impossible make revolution inevitable"", and if the ruling class persists on its course, they may very well see civil unrest that they are unable to successfully put down. What form could that take? Will they be able to put down the backlash successfully, despite themselves? If so, for how long? Is the left too fractured and disorganized to engage in militant struggle, and if so, will they always be? Also- am I wrong in saying that the bourgeois state is underestimating the left? Are they in fact prepared for all eventualities? Discuss.",18,3,1652671659.0

z420bx,Liberal,Explain the reasoning for wanting to reduce oil production in the USA for climate change.,space________cowboy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/z420bx/explain_the_reasoning_for_wanting_to_reduce_oil/,"I am not sure if I am just completely clueless but those who are liberals/democrats help me to understand this point. I might just be plain wrong and would like to be educated.

If the USA wanted to become a “greener” nation, why would we produce oil anywhere else but domestically? 

It seems like, since Biden shut down new fracking, we are buying more oil from Russia. In my head I am thinking that: 

1. Russia does not have as strict regulations for fracking/transporting oil compared to the USA. (No EPA)

2. It has to be transported a farther distance thus increasing risk for spills.

3. And Russia does not seem to have as many regulations regarding the disposal/cleanup of oil.

So in a nutshell; would it not be “better for the environment” to produce oil here domestically? Versus buying it from Russia who produces it in a far less green way? 

Please no hate. I am genuinely trying to understand the reasoning for climate activists wanting to reduce oil production here but support production overseas where it is arguably worse environmentally.",0,43,1669344957.0

One person commented it was time to vote Green Party. 

I thought maybe we could talk about it.

You have a two party system in the US. Not voting Democratic Party because they only give you incremental progress only sets you backwards. Republicans will do nothing to advance your agenda. The last 6 years proved it. 

There is such a thing as incremental progress.

If more folks kept this in mind y’all would’ve made way more progress in the last 6 years than you could’ve hoped for.

Look what you managed in just 2 years.

Instead these people who want instant gratification are a big part of why you’ve lost major progress of the last 50+ years and more to come.

Crawl. Walk. Run.

Democrats compromised. Yes. But they still gave you something. The needle still moved further in the direction of progress.

Republicans would’ve moved the needle backwards.

Let’s stop complaining, take our wins, build on them and realize the only way to many of our collective end goals is by making slow but steady progress towards them.

We may take two steps forwards and one step backwards sometimes under Democratic leadership. But we are still making progress.",26,12,1660360758.0

12w93nz,Republican,Woke liberals are bashing conservatives for not being able to define woke: You all need to know what woke is,Informal_Oven_2436,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/12w93nz/woke_liberals_are_bashing_conservatives_for_not/,"I spent 10 years in university, so I know and hate woke more than anyone. Please note that woke is a similar to the terms ""social justice (and social justice warriors),"" ""political correctness,"" and ""illiberal liberalism"". If we all want to fight woke, we need to know exactly what we're dealing with. 

At the heart, woke/social justice is antithetical to the western civilization's development of ""liberalism"" and the ""Enlightenment"". The grand ideas of liberalism and the Enlightenment are free speech, individualism (treat/judge you as a person), limits on state power, capitalism, individual rights, meritocracy (choosing the best for the job), scientific advancement etc. These ideas emerged out of the Protestant Reformation and are the bedrock of western civilization. 

Woke/social justice is a recycling of Marxism. At the core and put very, very simply, Marxism can be understood as the proletariat/factory owner dichotomy. And this is framed as either the oppressed or the oppressor. Capitalism and liberalism are bad and must be abolished and overturned etc etc etc. Woke has taken this dichotomy of oppressed/oppressor and made two classes of people in today's society. And the game is almost exclusively fought along race, gender identity, and sexual preferences (however these can change in the future). Oppressed racial categories are black, indigenous/native, Latino/Latina etc whereas oppressor racial categories are white (and Asian to a lesser extent). Oppressed sexual identities are gay, bisexual, pansexual etc whereas oppressor categories are straight. Oppressed gender identity categories are transgender, gender non-binary etc and the main oppressor category is cis-gender (biological males who ""feel"" male). Woke ideology does not judge people based on how they are as a person, but according to the group identity of whatever race they are, what their sexual orientation is, and what their gender identity is. 

Nearly everything woke (minus climate change) is about increasing the awareness of racial, gender, and sexual minorities and acknowledging the privilege of the oppressor. And the ultimate oppressor is a white, straight man/male. If you pay close attention, the government, corporations, major news media, social media, universities are pushing this narrative above all else - race, sex, and gender all day, every day. Every is about DEI - diversity, equity and inclusion and it's all about race, gender, and sex. 

Ever wonder why the oppressed categories pushed by Woke don't talk about burn victims? Or the blind, deaf, wheelchair bound, or people with chronic pain? Or people suffering from major mental illness like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder? Or people with major brain injuries or Alzheimer victims?  Or people dealing with cancer or strokes? Or sexual assault survivors? Or poor people? Or people whose parents, kids, grandparents, best friends etc have just died? Or pretty much anything else? Who decided that being transgender or gay was more of a ""victim"" than a deaf person or a burn victim or someone dying of cancer or any other ""victim""?

So when people ask you what is woke, you can simplify it as the obsession of the oppressor/oppressed categories taken from Marxism and applied to racial, sexual preference, and gender identity minorities. And then you can say I don't like how Woke ""privileges"" some categories (race, sex, and gender) while excluding other ""victim"" categories like burn victims, cancer patients, sexual assault survivors etc etc.",51,33,1682257317.0

ypa92w,Liberty,Theories as to why Gen Z is so authoritarian,CutEmOff666,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberty/comments/ypa92w/theories_as_to_why_gen_z_is_so_authoritarian/,"As someone who is now 22 and part of the older segment of Gen Z, I seem to have noticed that many of my fellow Gen Zs seem to have some serious authoritarian tendencies. Below I will explain some of the things that I think have contributed to this phenomenon:

1. People who are part of Gen Z are more likely to have grown up with helicopter and/or overprotective parents. As a result on this type of parenting being the norm for Gen Z, people from Gen Z are more likely to lacking in independent living skills and tend to be more sheltered or at least grow up more sheltered. They pretty much grow up in a bubble and when that bubble is burst, they ask that their parents or the government come take care of them because becoming independent at an older age can be very stressful and anxiety inducing. Also, when somebody lacks freedom and independence when they are young, they tend to have less appreciation for these things.
2. Gen Z gets exposed to a lot of doom and gloom and that a lot of aspects of society are in crisis. When people view a situation as extreme, they are more likely to demand more extreme solutions to solve these real or perceived extreme problems. The type of activism we see with the 'world is going to end in 5 years because of climate change' activists is a great example of this phenomenon.
3. It isn't unusual for people to think that the things that they grew up with a normal and acceptable. Many people who are part of Gen Z can not remember a world without cancel culture and hence view it as normal which resulted in them viewing it as acceptable. Many people who are part of Gen Z are witnessing the dogmatic behaviour of their parents on culture war issues and they are absorbing it like sponges.
4. Social media has created an environment where people are under pressure to conform to standards that are unreasonable and unrealistic. Constant censorship has pushed people into echo chambers and since so many people self censor, extreme stances that aren't that popular in real life appear to be more popular than they actually are. Gen Z spends a lot of time on social media and it is hard not to be affected. Social media can act like an enforcement tool for conformity which is more associated authoritarian mindsets and many people on social media including much of Gen Z are competing to be the biggest conformists for the likes and instant gratification from their peers.
5. Many people who are part of Gen Z don't realise that changing people's minds and world isn't something that can usually be done over night. When people don't instantly change their minds because very few people change their entire worldview over night, they get triggered and frustrated and think that the only solution is to force their worldview on the other person.
6. Rebellion is currently medicalised. Many of those kids who would have become our generations rebels or part of our counter culture are sent to a psychologist, labeled 'mentally ill' and gaslighted and drugged into submission to ensure conformity.
7. Lockdowns and other covid measures stunted the development of Gen Z in many ways including contributing to many of the issues above. Many young people had their maturity stunted at the age they were at the beginning of 2020 and the lockdowns severely limited the ability of Gen Z to grow, experience things and gain independence since they were all locked inside all day with little stimulation, lots of social media and little way to gain realistic life experience. Many people around my age were in university when 2020 came around. University is meant to be a time when young people grow, mature, accelerate their independence and get real life experience. Lockdowns significant derailed this and result in many university students experiencing what could be best described as an authoritarian regime simulation with universities excreting insane control over every aspect of a university students life during this period.",12,6,1667879209.0

yq5bcd,Anarcho_Capitalism,Big Oil promotes climate change alarmism to prevent competition in the market for oil,Rddtis4butts,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/yq5bcd/big_oil_promotes_climate_change_alarmism_to/,"One of the Global Environment Facility's specialties is ""debt-for-nature swaps,"" where Third World countries are given debt relief in return for opening their land up for environmental development projects. The projects come with transaction costs of up to 5%, paid to the contractors who manage and direct the investments, not to the locals who, like the aborigines of Palawan island, are kicked off their land and effectively wiped off the face of the map.

The Earth Summit also gave rise to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the body to which the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change delivers its reports. Generally thought to be neutral, non-governmental bodies relying only on science and evidence, the UNFCCC and the IPCC are handcuffed by the terms that Strong set out for them to deliver only one conclusion: that humanity is to blame for climate change.

Dr. Tim Ball: When they set up the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Maurice Strong, who we should talk a lot about, he wrote the terms of reference and the first term of reference was the definition of climate change and he limited it, deliberately, to only human causes of climate change. Of course that effectively eliminated all of the natural causes and natural variability which is why you see them not looking at things like the sun and a whole bunch of other issues. He then limited it even further in another term of reference, he set it up into three working groups. There was the technical group, Working Group 1, which wrote the science report, and that was 600 of the 2,500 people. The other 1,900 people were in Working Groups 2 & 3. Now they were inconsequential because they had to accept the findings of Working Group 1, which were already limited by their terms of reference. So whatever their finding was, Working Groups 2 & 3 then said, ""OK, you're telling us it's going to warm, we accept that as fact. We now look at the implications of that,"" and that's where you hear all these stories of the ice is going to melt, the sea-levels are going to rise, etc.

So really, the majority of the report by 1,900 scientists is accepting without question the finding of the first group. Now Strong really restricted it even more because they then came and said, ""Now look, this report is not to be used for policy,"" but then they set up the Summary for Policymakers, the absolute contradiction of that. The Summary for Policymakers is written by a completely separate group, and then they write independent of the science report. The science report is finished and set aside. The Summary for Policymakers is written and given out to the media, but the rules — the terms of reference that Strong set out — said that the Summary for Policymakers goes back to the science report people and says make sure your science report agrees with what we've put in the summary.

But on a strategic basis, what's happening is that there's a massive resource grab going on all over the planet. And when I say resource grab, you have to put yourself in Rockefellers' shoes — the bankers' shoes and the Rothschilds' shoes or whatever — and say, ""What do you do when money runs out? What do you do? When you suck all of the value that you can out of the monetary systems you've created, what's left?""

Well, you and I don't think about those sort of things because we don't have that have much money, but these people at the top, especially the bankers, I'm sure they stay up at night thinking, ""What's after money? What comes after money?"" The Rockefeller family especially has always been a resource intensive family. That's what oil was all about in the first place. It was a resource and they understood that energy would be the most important factor in the world over any other type of resource. They understood that, that's why they wanted to create a monopoly over energy.

Well, today as money has been sucked dry, the only thing left to do is to make a grab for the resources themselves and that's what sustainable development is all about. It's taking the resources of the world away from you and me, away from private companies that aren't part of the clique, if you will, and putting them into a global common trust that will be managed by them for their benefit. This is really nothing more than neo-feudalism again where the resources are owned by a few and everybody else gets to operate with those resources at their pleasure and discretion.

123cqhw,Anarcho_Capitalism,Can or should the government be privatized (instead of being eliminated)?,Opposite-Bullfrog-57,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/123cqhw/can_or_should_the_government_be_privatized/,"There are 2 tenets of libertarianism that I used to believe. However, now I have a hard time seeing this as absolute.

1. Taxation is theft/robbery (I prefer calling it protection fee, but you got the point).
2. Not leaving a city/region/country does not mean consenting to the law in the area.

Notice  the difference between tax and protection fee is minor morally. Any  Mafia can charge a protection fee. I do see government as another mafia.  That being said, there is a difference between a rag tag mafia armed  with knives and a government with a sophisticated justice system that is  acknowledged by UN and other countries. Government is a really really  big mafia. So morally I do not see much problem in those area.

Practically I see a lot. The idea that taxation is theft means libertarian country is pretty much impossible.

Recently someone tell me a solution on jail and punishment in ancap.

>Owner:   Welcome to Hill City! One regulation in the contract is that if you   commit a crime we will send you to a private prison. Is that okay?Criminal: Yes*Criminal commits crime*Owner: You're going to prisonCriminal: You can't make me, that's an NAP violation!Owner: You consented in the contract! I'm calling security.

You can see the conversation here: [https://new.reddit.com/r/Anarcho\_Capitalism/comments/121kv7v/wha\_does\_ancap\_think\_about\_jail\_or\_death\_penalty/](https://new.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/121kv7v/wha_does_ancap_think_about_jail_or_death_penalty/)

I have no problem with that logic. Cities should have owners. People in the city should be subject to the rule of the owners.

There  are small issues like illegal immigrants and people born in the city.  However, normal property right means if cities have owners, the owners  make the rule. To a certain extent, the owners can rule the city.

There  could be some limitation. Things like a city owner shouldn't have right  to abruptly change tax. That means land owners in that city do not have  proper time to get out. But the limitation should be much more lenient  than libertarian rule that tax must be 0. It's enough that the tax rate  don't change abruptly so people in and around the city can make informed  decision whether to stay or move in or move out to the city.

If you like democracy, this can be democratic too. Just like apartment owners can collectively own the building where their apartments are located, it makes sense for people that live in the city to collectively own the city where they live.

Instead of granting every newborn and newcomer citizenship, it can be done like building ownership. Things like only owners and renters can live and people have to buy or pay for their right to live there.

The same way, only citizens or visa paying immigrants can live and they have to pay market price. Those who want to be citizen have to buy from those wanting to sell. So we have fungile citizenship and residency market.

In  fact, that is the corner point of what I think the path of the least  resistance to lower tax and smaller government. Cities must have owners.  Voters should have similar incentives with shareholders. Countries  should have clear owners too. Citizenship should be like shares, owned  by buying and selling instead of by birthright.

It's  a very peaceful path that would naturally lead to ancapistan or  minarchism or whatever. Doesn't have to be perfect, but as long as we  can move to where we like so what?

I actually wrote a parody about this.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho\_Capitalism/comments/121lwvg/this\_is\_what\_taxation\_is\_theft\_looks\_like\_to\_me/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/121lwvg/this_is_what_taxation_is_theft_looks_like_to_me/)

However, that's not what most ancap think.

The  Forprofita kingdom in that parody is actually a private corporation  with CEO and shareholders. I just use words like king to replace CEO and  call their protection service fee tax or visa tax. It's completely  equivalent, just with different wording. Some minor differences may  exist and actually significant. A country that can set up it's own tax  would probably have to be acknowledged by UN and other nations as a  ""legitimate"" country. So it's a private property that is also it's  territory.

Most ancap think that  no government should exist and taxation should be 0. Also ancaps think  that you can live in a city without obeying the cities' rule because not  leaving doesn't mean consenting.

In  fact, the democracy idea of anyone can enter a city and rule the city  instead of being ruled by the city is the main impediment to  libertarianism. Which is kind of ironic because most libertarians favor  open border.

No city can be  sufficiently capitalistic if commies have right to just come and vote  communism. Even if those commies can vote, it's hard to maintain  libertarian ideal if too many commies are there.

Normal owners can keep undesired guests and customers out. I see no reason why private cities can keep illegal immigrants out.

I  disagree with taxation is theft principle. I think coming to a city and  staying there means effectively consenting to the rule in that city.  That means government rules on a city is justified. If I go and live in  Singapore, then Singaporean kings, voters, president, or whatever, have  right to tax me.

However, when  government is communist like USA, I can see that taxation is theft make  some sense too. I don't see it's wrong that USA tax people that live in  US. I also do not see anything wrong with anyone living in US and does  their best avoiding or evading tax.

Like any business, a government  should be able to enforce it's rules. Taxing income using nosy tactic is  just a bad implementation that deserves a lot of tax evasion. But I  don't see one is right or another is wrong.

So which side are you?

To reiterate:

1. Most libertarians think that government should be minimal
2. I think government and nation-states, cities, and provinces should behave more like private communes/communities

That's it. It doesn't even have to be minimal though competition among states and huge inefficiency of government will make government minimal.

ypa5j4,Anarcho_Capitalism,Theories as to why Gen Z is so authoritarian,CutEmOff666,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/ypa5j4/theories_as_to_why_gen_z_is_so_authoritarian/,"As someone who is now 22 and part of the older segment of Gen Z, I seem to have noticed that many of my fellow Gen Zs seem to have some serious authoritarian tendencies. Below I will explain some of the things that I think have contributed to this phenomenon:

1. People who are part of Gen Z are more likely to have grown up with helicopter and/or overprotective parents. As a result on this type of parenting being the norm for Gen Z, people from Gen Z are more likely to lacking in independent living skills and tend to be more sheltered or at least grow up more sheltered. They pretty much grow up in a bubble and when that bubble is burst, they ask that their parents or the government come take care of them because becoming independent at an older age can be very stressful and anxiety inducing. Also, when somebody lacks freedom and independence when they are young, they tend to have less appreciation for these things.
2. Gen Z gets exposed to a lot of doom and gloom and that a lot of aspects of society are in crisis. When people view a situation as extreme, they are more likely to demand more extreme solutions to solve these real or perceived extreme problems. The type of activism we see with the 'world is going to end in 5 years because of climate change' activists is a great example of this phenomenon. 
3. It isn't unusual for people to think that the things that they grew up with a normal and acceptable. Many people who are part of Gen Z can not remember a world without cancel culture and hence view it as normal which resulted in them viewing it as acceptable. Many people who are part of Gen Z are witnessing the dogmatic behaviour of their parents on culture war issues and they are absorbing it like sponges. 
4. Social media has created an environment where people are under pressure to conform to standards that are unreasonable and unrealistic. Constant censorship has pushed people into echo chambers and since so many people self censor, extreme stances that aren't that popular in real life appear to be more popular than they actually are. Gen Z spends a lot of time on social media and it is hard not to be affected. Social media can act like an enforcement tool for conformity which is more associated authoritarian mindsets and many people on social media including much of Gen Z are competing to be the biggest conformists for the likes and instant gratification from their peers.
5. Many people who are part of Gen Z don't realise that changing people's minds and world isn't something that can usually be done over night. When people don't instantly change their minds because very few people change their entire worldview over night, they get triggered and frustrated and think that the only solution is to force their worldview on the other person.
6. Rebellion is currently medicalised. Many of those kids who would have become our generations rebels or part of our counter culture are sent to a psychologist, labeled 'mentally ill' and gaslighted and drugged into submission to ensure conformity. 
7. Lockdowns and other covid measures stunted the development of Gen Z in many ways including contributing to many of the issues above. Many young people had their maturity stunted at the age they were at the beginning of 2020 and the lockdowns severely limited the ability of Gen Z to grow, experience things and gain independence since they were all locked inside all day with little stimulation, lots of social media and little way to gain realistic life experience. Many people around my age were in university when 2020 came around. University is meant to be a time when young people grow, mature, accelerate their independence and get real life experience. Lockdowns significant derailed this and result in many university students experiencing what could be best described as an authoritarian regime simulation with universities excreting insane control over every aspect of a university students life during this period.",72,41,1667878923.0

**Operation Earnest Voice**

Operation Earnest Voice (OEV) is a communications program by the United States Central Command (CENTCOM). Initially, the program was developed as a psychological weapon and was first used in Iraq. In 2011, the US government signed a $2.8 million contract with the Ntrepid web-security company to develop a specialized software, allowing agents of the government to post propaganda. The aim of the initiative is to use sockpuppets to spread pro-American propaganda on social networking services.

Main characteristics of the software, as stated in the software development request, are:

Fifty user ""operator"" licenses, 10 sockpuppets controllable by each user.

Sockpuppets are to be ""replete with background, history, supporting details, and cyber presences that are technically, culturally and geographically consistent."" Sockpuppets are to ""be able to appear to originate in nearly any part of the world.""

A special secure VPN, allowing sockpuppets to appear to be posting from ""randomly selected IP addresses,"" in order to ""hide the existence of the operation.""

Fifty static IP addresses to enable government agencies to ""manage their persistent online personas,"" with identities of government and enterprise organizations protected which will allow for different state agents to use the same sockpuppet, and easily switch between different sockpuppets to ""look like ordinary users as opposed to one organization.""

Nine private servers, ""based on the geographic area of operations the customer is operating within and which allow a customer's online persona(s) to appear to originate from."" These servers should use commercial hosting centers around the world.

Virtual machine environments, deleted after each session termination, to avoid interaction with ""any virus, worm, or malicious software.""

The German Club of Clear Words takes a deep dive into the network of individuals and organizations responsible for the COVID scam

Whether blatantly visible or not, you can identify just about any network by connecting dots between individuals and organizations. Who’s working with whom, where, and why? Who’s paying whom? And once you’ve done that, you can more clearly identify the motivations behind various decisions

The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation appears to be near the top, or the center, of this COVID plandemic network. Gates is also a major funder of mainstream media, and his network extends into global food and climate change policy

The Gates Foundation, through its funding of the WEF, also plays an important role in The Great Reset, which was officially unveiled during a WEF summit in May 2020

Every conceivable aspect of life and society is scheduled to be “reset” according to their plan. Ultimately, that’s where this criminal COVID enterprise is trying to take us.

Those people are now trying to reshape the world via the CV-19 fear-based agenda in order to gain more power and control for themselves and bring about an AI-controlled dystopian future that benefits them even more greatly. Ignore it at your own peril. They call it The Great Reset. It involves travel restrictions, tracking, tracing, mandatory vaccination, monitoring, surveillance, digital currency, 5G to implement the global control, etc. Its all right there on their own website... plain as day. They aren't even hiding it from the public anymore.

Excerpt:

Their operating budget for fiscal year 2016 was US$752 million.

U.S. Government Accountability Office Audit Report

https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-22-104017

Excerpt:

Amendments to legislation have affected USAGM's governing authorities and organizational structure by shifting authority from a bipartisan board to a Chief Executive Officer (CEO), with advice from an Advisory Board. Network and USAGM officials said that previous members of USAGM leadership took several actions that did not align with USAGM's firewall principles. According to USAGM, the firewall protecting the networks' independence is central to the credibility and effectiveness of USAGM's networks (see fig.). However, the parameters of the firewall are not specifically laid out in legislation. Delineation of what is and is not permissible under the firewall may help ensure the professional independence and integrity of the agency and its networks.

Actions to ensure accountability of grantees, such as establishing Standard Operating Procedures for Monitoring Grants , have not corrected a longstanding significant deficiency in grants monitoring reported by independent audits of USAGM's financial statements for the past 5 years.

The biggest companies have the strongest ties to the government and they all work together and get endless government contracts. They get money if they fail and they get more money the more money they spend on their projects. Not all of them of course. But we all benefit from endless wars and forcing other countries to use the dollar as their international currency. 

Social media and big tech is just another branch of the government. They get a lot of government subsides  and they work with the government in controlling information.

The government can bust into our personal space if they have probably cause. The FBI can target anyone and make their life hell. The government can seize our property because our property has no rights. They can seize all our money for any excuse.

They can also suspend all our rights if there is a ""national emergency"" or a ""crisis"". They can suspend our constitution indefinitely. They can go to war over anything and they can give terrorist billions of dollars worth of military equipment. 

They control what we are allowed to eat and what healthcare we are allowed to get and a lot of it is not healthy considering America's obesity problem. 

Lately its becoming more and more obvious. Conservatives are finally seeing the police and FBI as people who are not on their side. (Not all of course)

You're average liberal refuses to see. ""NO NO that is not true You are just a crazy Qanon Nut Job! That is hate speech and misinformation! You are an extremist who doesn't support our democracy! You are a traitor and an enemy of we the People!"" 

Your average liberal isn't much of a liberal anymore. They are more of a progressive who continues to vote for more government. They are communist who believe human development and abundance is a cancer on the planet that needs to be stop in order to slow down climate change.

All while the stupid ass liberal elites will continue to fly around in their private jets and keep their private cars and what not. 

The state controls almost everything and everyone to a certain extent. They control the means of production, our energy our money the information we are allowed to view. 

They were literally able to get almost everyone to stay home and killed off hundreds of thousands of small businesses over a flu bug.

I don't mean to spread fear but we should be more informed of this. Maybe its been this way for hundreds of years but its gotten worse. The pandemic was just the first small wave. Bigger waves will come.

The people who rule us hate the middle class and all Americans. They want to make everyone into a dumb stupid ugly peasant. Thats why ""education"" at the universities and public schools is of low quality. Thats why there are more and more homeless people.

Yoiur average leftist will say ""Well the problem is this free market capitalism! The problem is greed and people wanting to make a profit. Money is the root of all evil!""  This is not true. The only other alternative to people not being allowed to trade with each other is force through the threat of violence. Money is not evil. But the state has corrupted the dollar and made it evil.

I don't think our survival chances are increased by burning our money in a pit of corruption and calculation errors.

Also, if the literal survival of the human race is at stake, you would think nuclear power's pitiful death count could be somehow justified at the very least.

When approaching the scientific evidence of man made climate change, it's frightening how disabused people are of basic incredulity regarding methodology and incentives. Every climate scientist's funding can be traced back to the state, every polemic can be instantly dismissed as a denier, and anyone who so much as took a stick of gum from an oil company is a permanent shill.

We need supercomputers and scale models in order to calculate fluid dynamics on systems as small deltaworks, locks and sea walls, but the entire planet is so well figured out to justify taxing and herding our behaviour immediately. Evidently we need a 10 year double blinded study to justify any medical intervention that wasn't their idea, no matter how harmless, but we're meant to take climate data and predictions for which there cannot be a control, and whose models and their assumptions almost entirely determine the conclusions, at face value

It's not a new observation that the state hates the church as a competing power structure. However, I think the particular tool being co-opted here is the concept of original sin. Most successful cultures had a way of dealing with our natural inclination toward feeling guilty. Though the emotions have genuine purpose in encouraging the empathy and subsequent cooperation needed for our survival, the application of the emotion is not exactly rational, we have so much guilt that we go searching for things to attract the feeling to. For better or worse, most religions provided an outlet for guilt: there's a strict code of ethics (commandments, scripture) and a way to deal with it (penance, redemption). As that faded, the state took up the reigns of original sin, and we're now being told positively absurd things like ""That flood in South America? that was because YOU didn't do YOUR SHARE""",311,140,1657213016.0

Amendments to legislation have affected USAGM's governing authorities and organizational structure by shifting authority from a bipartisan board to a Chief Executive Officer (CEO), with advice from an Advisory Board. Network and USAGM officials said that previous members of USAGM leadership took several actions that did not align with USAGM's firewall principles. According to USAGM, the firewall protecting the networks' independence is central to the credibility and effectiveness of USAGM's networks (see fig.). However, the parameters of the firewall are not specifically laid out in legislation. Delineation of what is and is not permissible under the firewall may help ensure the professional independence and integrity of the agency and its networks.

Actions to ensure accountability of grantees, such as establishing Standard Operating Procedures for Monitoring Grants , have not corrected a longstanding significant deficiency in grants monitoring reported by independent audits of USAGM's financial statements for the past 5 years.

**Operation Earnest Voice**

Operation Earnest Voice (OEV) is a communications program by the United States Central Command (CENTCOM). Initially, the program was developed as a psychological weapon and was first used in Iraq. In 2011, the US government signed a $2.8 million contract with the Ntrepid web-security company to develop a specialized software, allowing agents of the government to post propaganda. The aim of the initiative is to use sockpuppets to spread pro-American propaganda on social networking services.

Main characteristics of the software, as stated in the software development request, are:

Fifty user ""operator"" licenses, 10 sockpuppets controllable by each user.

Sockpuppets are to be ""replete with background, history, supporting details, and cyber presences that are technically, culturally and geographically consistent."" Sockpuppets are to ""be able to appear to originate in nearly any part of the world.""

A special secure VPN, allowing sockpuppets to appear to be posting from ""randomly selected IP addresses,"" in order to ""hide the existence of the operation.""

Fifty static IP addresses to enable government agencies to ""manage their persistent online personas,"" with identities of government and enterprise organizations protected which will allow for different state agents to use the same sockpuppet, and easily switch between different sockpuppets to ""look like ordinary users as opposed to one organization.""

Nine private servers, ""based on the geographic area of operations the customer is operating within and which allow a customer's online persona(s) to appear to originate from."" These servers should use commercial hosting centers around the world.

Virtual machine environments, deleted after each session termination, to avoid interaction with ""any virus, worm, or malicious software.""

The German Club of Clear Words takes a deep dive into the network of individuals and organizations responsible for the COVID scam

Whether blatantly visible or not, you can identify just about any network by connecting dots between individuals and organizations. Who’s working with whom, where, and why? Who’s paying whom? And once you’ve done that, you can more clearly identify the motivations behind various decisions

The Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation appears to be near the top, or the center, of this COVID plandemic network. Gates is also a major funder of mainstream media, and his network extends into global food and climate change policy

The Gates Foundation, through its funding of the WEF, also plays an important role in The Great Reset, which was officially unveiled during a WEF summit in May 2020

Every conceivable aspect of life and society is scheduled to be “reset” according to their plan. Ultimately, that’s where this criminal COVID enterprise is trying to take us.

Those people are now trying to reshape the world via the CV-19 fear-based agenda in order to gain more power and control for themselves and bring about an AI-controlled dystopian future that benefits them even more greatly. Ignore it at your own peril. They call it The Great Reset. It involves travel restrictions, tracking, tracing, mandatory vaccination, monitoring, surveillance, digital currency, 5G to implement the global control, etc. Its all right there on their own website... plain as day. They aren't even hiding it from the public anymore.

I don't know about you, but I for one try my best to not blindly trust claims but rather verify claims. Here's what's really going on.

It's the government stupid.

(Chart: U.S. All Grades All Formulations Retail Gasoline Prices)

This graph shows you the weekly gas prices. Notice how before 2004 the price of gas was fairly stable. Then gas hit a national average of $4.11 (All time high) in 2008 before ultimately crashing. It's been averaging down ever since, until … November 2020. Anyone want to guess what happened? That's right, Biden was elected President.

(Crude Oil Prices 70-Year Historical Chart) 

This Graph represents the price of oil. Notice how oil is significantly less then it was in 2008, but yet gas is at an all time high at $5.80 (National Average) why is that? You understand why the argument of ""high gas prices is purely a result of of high oil prices"" would be false, right? 

The other argument we hear often is ""Big Oil Companies Are Being Greedy"". Let me show you why that's not the case. 

Most of us understand business operate under margins, if they have added costs guess what … They're not paying it, you are. You've probably heard of a term called "" Demand Pull"" but have you heard of the term "" Cost Push""? 

[https://www.foxbusiness.com/energy/timeline-biden-actions-oil-gas-priorities](https://www.foxbusiness.com/energy/timeline-biden-actions-oil-gas-priorities)

(A Timeline of Biden's Actions on Oil And Gas)

 **January 20, 2021** : Biden’s first actions was to revoke approval for the Keystone XL, and impose a moratorium on oil and gas leasing federal lands and waters . Roughly 25% of U.S. production comes from federal areas. 

Regulation & you've just eliminated 25% of the U.S supply. Does anyone know how supply and demand works? Did he stop there? Of course not!

 

**February 26, 2021:**  Biden updates the ""social cost of greenhouse gas emissions,"" dramatically altering the way the U.S. government calculates the real-world costs of climate change.  The administration plans boost the figure it will use to assess greenhouse gas pollution's damage inflicts on society to $51 per ton of carbon dioxide (**Seven times higher**) . This would apply to any new oil and gas lease sale, raising producers’ costs to deliver new supplies. 

Another Tax expense on something that can't even be measured   
accurately, $51 per ton  (7X Higher) who pays for it? You! Cost push, you thin I'm done? I've only started.  

&#x200B;

 **June 1, 2021:**  Eliminating a slew of tax benefits for oil, gas and coal producers.  Eliminating these tax provisions imperils U.S. energy security by raising costs for domestic producers and would increase America’s reliance on foreign energy supplies. 

Ohh so you removed tax benefits issued by the previous administration, sounds like an added cost. Who pays? You! 

 

**August 11, 2021:** Biden calls on OPEC+ producers to increase supply to help curb rising oil prices, even though the U.S. is one of the three largest producers in the world and can deliver supply with a lower carbon footprint 

We're the top producer of oil in the entire world, yet we've become dependent on countries like Venezuela and Saudi Arabia . Not only can we supply ourselves with oil but we could do it with less carbon foot print then the rest of the world.

( The Biden administration has set new requirements that increase the amount of ethanol that must be blended into the nation’s gasoline supply.) 

If all this wasn't bad enough now we have people who produce nothing (Politicians) telling the private sector how to produce oil. They want to increase the use of ethanol in gas. 

I'll make the argument on why ethanol is a horrible idea in bullet points.

*  95% of ethanol is produced from corn , we have a major corn shortage. This will worsen the already bad food supply. 
* Expect increase use in fertilizer also experiencing a major shortage .
* Ethanol can be extremely damaging to engines and high-powered sports equipment, leading to corrosion of the engine and fuel system.

**Operation Earnest Voice**

Operation Earnest Voice (OEV) is a communications program by the United States Central Command (CENTCOM). Initially, the program was developed as a psychological weapon and was first used in Iraq. In 2011, the US government signed a $2.8 million contract with the Ntrepid web-security company to develop a specialized software, allowing agents of the government to post propaganda. The aim of the initiative is to use sockpuppets to spread pro-American propaganda on social networking services.

Main characteristics of the software, as stated in the software development request, are:

Fifty user ""operator"" licenses, 10 sockpuppets controllable by each user.

Sockpuppets are to be ""replete with background, history, supporting details, and cyber presences that are technically, culturally and geographically consistent."" Sockpuppets are to ""be able to appear to originate in nearly any part of the world.""

A special secure VPN, allowing sockpuppets to appear to be posting from ""randomly selected IP addresses,"" in order to ""hide the existence of the operation.""

Fifty static IP addresses to enable government agencies to ""manage their persistent online personas,"" with identities of government and enterprise organizations protected which will allow for different state agents to use the same sockpuppet, and easily switch between different sockpuppets to ""look like ordinary users as opposed to one organization.""

Nine private servers, ""based on the geographic area of operations the customer is operating within and which allow a customer's online persona(s) to appear to originate from."" These servers should use commercial hosting centers around the world.

Virtual machine environments, deleted after each session termination, to avoid interaction with ""any virus, worm, or malicious software.""

Whether blatantly visible or not, you can identify just about any network by connecting dots between individuals and organizations. Who’s working with whom, where, and why? Who’s paying whom? And once you’ve done that, you can more clearly identify the motivations behind various decisions

The Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation appears to be near the top, or the center, of this COVID plandemic network. Gates is also a major funder of mainstream media, and his network extends into global food and climate change policy

The Gates Foundation, through its funding of the WEF, also plays an important role in The Great Reset, which was officially unveiled during a WEF summit in May 2020

Every conceivable aspect of life and society is scheduled to be “reset” according to their plan. Ultimately, that’s where this criminal COVID enterprise is trying to take us.

Those people are now trying to reshape the world via the CV-19 fear-based agenda in order to gain more power and control for themselves and bring about an AI-controlled dystopian future that benefits them even more greatly. Ignore it at your own peril. They call it The Great Reset. It involves travel restrictions, tracking, tracing, mandatory vaccination, monitoring, surveillance, digital currency, 5G to implement the global control, etc. Its all right there on their own website... plain as day. They aren't even hiding it from the public anymore.

It's absolutely bonkers. It's as bonkers as the progressive take that climate change is going to destroy our food production. You guys sound just as dumb.

Let's take it one idea at a time.

The US exports $177BIL worth of food every year. Exports. We make so much damn food that we ship it out and sell it to everyone else. It has been a constant problem that food production in the US is so high the government pays farmers to stop producing because we would collapse the food market. This has been going on since before you were born.

Oh no! Another fire! No shit sherlock. There are hundreds of thousands of ""food production plants"" in the US. Especially if my grandmas basement is considered a food production plant to you idiots. 97 fires this year seems low. We are coming off a few years where companies furloughed staff, cut corners on maintenance, and the government turned a blind eye during inspections. The 3,000 cows that died from that one farmer? That's .00005% of the cows in the US, dumb ass. Our food production is so massively large and decentralized you would need 10,000 fires to burn it down. And do you really think all the farmers and companies are going to just let you do it?

You know why food costs are so damn high? Diesel. Crops often are measured by fuel/acre. If you have 20gal/acre, your price for fuel alone went from $60 to $140. That's just to farm it. Farmers growing corn or soy bean can manage over 500 acres/farmer. That's $40,000 in fuel costs per farmer. Nuts. Now you have to truck it to a plant. They have to run machines. Then it needs to get trucked to a grocery store. All while we have to pay more per hour to everyone along that chain because inflation is hitting everywhere due to shitty monetary policy.

You think you are going to starve? Seriously?! Well over half the world makes less than $5/hour. You seriously believe that you are going to starve in a global economy where you can buy the same food they are eating? You are an idiot. It's beyond lunacy. It's on par with the global warming activists who said that we are destroying crop production when yields since An Inconvenient truth are up nearly 100%. Seriously. We aren't any worse.

And you are talking to a guy who is buying 10 acres just to farm it himself. I'll have a massive greenhouse, cows, chickens, maybe a goat, a pond stocked with fish, solar panels, and a well. You know why I am doing this? Because I can farm it cheaper and to a better quality than the grocery store. I don't have to worry about inflation once it's all built. I don't give a shit what diesel prices are.

vvr81h,Anarcho_Capitalism,A way to divide those who love freedom and those who want security/stability?,WhoFunkinCares,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/vvr81h/a_way_to_divide_those_who_love_freedom_and_those/,"Roughly, humans can be divided into these two categories:

**1. Those who prefer freedom to safety/stability.** They'd rather live in a world where criminals/terrorists/extremists can invent a way to abuse them, than in a theoretically ""safe"" world  where the only one who can abuse you is the gov't. Even if there was a model of perfectly-safe world, they'd reject it.

**2. Those who prefer stability/safety to freedom.** They'd rather live in chains and in cages but they would be fed, sheltered, cared for and secured against any scary-scary threats than live in a free world where bad things might happen.

&#x200B;

So, the main problem is three-component:

1. Those who prefer freedom are outnumbered.
2. Those who prefer freedom live in the same society as those who prefer safety/stability/care.
3. The society is majoritarian.

In other words, when some abstract Klaus Schwab invents another way to keep you in chains, he usually uses the ""safety"" as a reason to do so. Put you into pods? ""Climate change, do this or the Earth burns"". Eat bugs? ""Climate change, cows fart scary-scary methane *and I'm going to be silent about the methane-producing bacteria residing in various swamps which produce way more methane per mass unit than any cows and are more abundant in mass than all of the world's cows.*""

Safety, or care, or stability, are the primary reasons to push more restraint. And we the freedom-lovers could've ignored this... but we live in a safetist-dominated world for now. How unfortunate.

But. Numbers aren't the fate-sealer.

For example: China has about 1.5bn people and Russia has 155 million or so. So one would say Russia would've been easily dominated by China, but it doesn't seem so. Even though Russia is 10 times less populous, the Chinese totalitarian regime doesn't directly fuck with Russian totalitarian regime and their slave culture.

**Yes, China likely tries to subvert Russia through trickery, like they're trying to do with the West, but trickery isn't really something that requires supremacy in numbers.** 

So, there **are** ways for those who're few in numbers to secure themselves against those who're many. One of them seems to be living in a different society.

The explanation could lie in the fact that Russia is an organized society of 155 million citizens, not just random 155M citizens randomly mixed into a hybrid Russia+China society. Not all of them love Russia and not all of them have that nationalist patriotic mindset, but the system is crafted so they end up working and living as a single collective of sorts.

In the end, Russians end up creating some sorta apparatus which manages to keep them safe from the conquest-hungry Chinese. It's mostly a semi-abstract machine which is basically a bunch of local industries, workforce and military capabilities viewed as components of a single mechanism.

Not saying that you freedom-loving persons should build a huge nation overnight. But, my observation and analysis show a terribly low amount of interaction between you freedom-loving persons.

Building connections is potentially useful, in many aspects. Why not try building some?",0,1,1657458765.0

[Original](https://mises.org/wire/russian-economy-and-social-contract-path-deplorable-reality)

_by: Paul Tolmachev_

The social contract in autocracies and totalitarian dictatorships is characterized by the fact that power is always at the top of the triangle: state, business, society—business and society's nominal weight is always less than that of the state. In particular, this pattern of social structure is typical for Russia: society and business are in a subordinate position to power.

There are obvious reasons for this in particular the historical distance of power, low levels of individualism, and low coefficients of tolerance in time preference—i.e., aversion to change and unreadiness to take risks due to negative expectations and a low level of social trust. Among others, these factors produce a rutting effect that is perpetuated, in turn, by modern authoritarian power, as this state of affairs is optimal for maintaining the regime's equilibrium.

Russia has had several types of social contracts in recent times. The zero years began with reforms in which the basic idea of the social contract was to streamline sociopolitical and economic processes in order to stimulate economic development in exchange for disciplined tax payment and political loyalty to power. These reforms were, to a certain extent, liberal and positive with regard to the formation of a favorable environment for business and entrepreneurial initiative and certainly had a positive effect.

Such a social contract can be called a consumer contract, and its model is as follows. The state ""brings order""—i.e., tightens conditions in the political sphere. But at the same time, it creates adequate regulatory, judicial, and arbitration institutions for individual civil initiative (primarily entrepreneurial) and economic freedom, encouraging personal income growth. All this is done in exchange for constancy and openness in tax payments and loyalty to a now stronger power.

The need for a strong hand was quite logical, since the process of reforms and streamlining during Russia's transitional state of the nineties required that the state's ethical and ideological elasticity be reduced. The political toughening of the time, concerned predominantly oppositionist but systemic elites and bureaucratic elites (as shown, for example, by the abolition of gubernatorial elections and other steps to strengthen the power vertical).

At the same time, civic initiative, whatever its nature, was not persecuted on the whole and in some cases (entrepreneurship, consumer activity, civic self-organization, the development of the internet, and general accessibility of information) was systematically and actively encouraged. In general, we can say that the social contract was balanced and the exchange was equal: loyalty in exchange for security and social openness.

Gradually, as foreign economic conditions deteriorated, on the one hand, and the new affiliated elites' need to multiply and share new assets through control and budget distribution increased, on the other, this contract underwent changes. The changes came mainly from power, where demands for loyalty were growing and benefits for society were diminishing, where the opportunities for power were expanding and the opportunities for society were shrinking.

One of the new and main benefits of the modernizing contract for society offered metaphysical value—a sense of national greatness and a corresponding narrative of patriotism, a great country rising from its knees, the rebirth of the empire, deception and consumerism from Western democracies, the logically emerged concept of an external enemy, etc. Obviously, this new product of the social contract was a way for power to continue maximizing its own utility while reducing the potential associated costs in the form of social discontent and the threat of overthrow. In fact, instead of increasing prosperity and promoting the ""good life,"" power offered society an ideology for reasons both endogenous (the desire to consolidate its position and opportunities to control the rent resource—the budget) and exogenous (external economic shocks).

To get society to accept such a substitution in the terms and benefits of the contract, the authorities took two strategic steps: 1) a course toward conservative monetary and fiscal policy to avoid inflation as the main economic trigger of social discontent and 2) multilayered information manipulation to maximize the proliferation of a new imperial-isolationist ideology in society. The tools chosen were full control of the media, comprehensive propaganda bordering on common sense but with a strong national message, increasing repressive mechanisms, and the outright rejection and persecution of opposition. The society as a whole agreed with the amendments to the previous contract.

By 2014, again under the influence of external and internal conditions the state, feeling the growing canopy of social discontent as a major risk factor, decided to renew the social contract. The external conditions were continued deterioration of the foreign economic situation. Internally there was economic stagnation and falling incomes as a consequence of the deterioration of the business climate and reduced competition. In addition, there were strengthening bureaucratic institutions, expanding state property, growing corruption, and significantly increasing repressive pressure on society, not the system elites.

And Russia annexed Crimea, chose Ukraine as a threat to the Russian world. It also intensified the aggression of isolationist rhetoric toward Western democracies and appointed a dominant enemy in the United States. It finally shifted the opposition to the status of ""enemies of the people,"" in whatever forms this opposition presented itself—whether an organized political movement, media, and a private opinion. Repressive mechanisms became even more repressive. So, society again agreed to this renewal of the contract.

By 2020, the marginal cost of power to society again began to threaten the utility of power, and power went for a new renewal of the contract. Against the backdrop of pandemic, geopolitical, and external market imbalances, power further pumped up the previous ideological concept and further expanded the corresponding narrative with an even greater reduction of private rights and freedoms.

Tightened repression has become the norm and no longer even requires commentary or justification before the public, an assertion and a one-sentence statement suffice. The level of concentration and volume of propaganda is at totalitarian levels. The possibility of civic initiative and self-organization has been reduced to zero. 

Entrepreneurial activity and initiative are completely limited to the level of domestic service and hard work, the bureaucracy and affiliated business elites openly control budgetary resources and engage in rent entrepreneurship. An important fact in the legitimization of the new contract was the virtual cult of the domain personality and the complete elimination of the possibility of electoral alternation.

Firstly, this elimination has occurred through the final and actual devaluation of the institution of free elections that offer the possibility of legal representation of alternative political opinions and proposals and, secondly, through changes in the constitution and the removal of term limits for the supreme ruler. All this shifted Russia considerably from soft autocracy back to repressive autocracy on the verge of dictatorship, and even more precisely to the original model of the state as the sedentary bandit in Mancur Olson's models.

Judging by social statistics and indirect metrics, Russian society has accepted the new social contract. However, with the change of generations and a growing number of irrational and incompetent decisions of the authorities, the elasticity of society is decreasing: the costs of the authorities for society are beginning to approach their marginal values, judging by a steadily growing number of citizens sympathetic to any kind of opposition.

In particular, this growing openness to opposition indicates that the rating of the root ruling ""party"" is sharply declining throughout society. This is least true of the domain, which suggests that the rating is still declining but that the conditions and benefits for society of such a social contract are becoming less and less obvious. This could mean an increase in social ferment and a simultaneous increase in repressive pressure from the state, as well as attempts to renew legitimization and ""love of the people. This is an illustration of the inevitability of irrational decisions by power and actually shows the diminishing returns to its usefulness.

In fact, the only but very strong drivers of regime stability in the current situation and in some future are two factors: the domain personality factor and the macroeconomic stability factor. The domain persona factor is the trust of the overwhelming majority of citizens and the bureaucracy in the head of state, based on personal sympathies, cognitive distortions under the influence of propaganda, a low level of individual critical consciousness and a direct interest of the elites in maintaining the balance and status quo.

The factor of macroeconomic stability is maintaining a balanced budget and controlling inflationary expectations at a low level, on the one hand, and preserving the capitalist system as the basis of economic relations and the possibility of preserving consumer dynamics, on the other. If these factors remain stable, the present regime can maintain an equilibrium state and significantly prolong its existence. 

However, in reality both these drivers begin to shift the situation from the equilibrium state. Firstly, the number of irrational decisions of the authorities, in particular, strengthening repressions and restrictions of rights and freedoms, decisions under the influence of intergroup conflicts within the elites, decisions in the absence of sources of direct and real signals about public preferences, is getting larger and larger.

On the other hand, forced (in the absence of significant economic growth and business activity) fiscal and monetary policy tightening in the form of raising the retirement age, increasing tax rates and the introduction of new taxes, increasing rates to control inflation and the inevitable decline in personal income and purchasing power also contribute to the growth of social discontent. At the same time, most of all of the mentioned steps are forced to be voiced by the head of state directly in his address to citizens. It may lead to a sense of breach of contract even among the most loyal part of society, which means that confidence in the domain is obviously undermined and reduces the stability of the regime as a whole.

In terms of the factor of macroeconomic stability, the risks of imbalance are somewhat lower, since accumulated reserves, low debt and possible situational growth of commodity assets from time to time, as well as the preservation of the capitalist frame of the economy can help to maintain economic stability. It may also support a sense of material stability in the population, even if there is no growth, even if welfare levels are at a low level.

However, given the total dependence of the Russian budget—namely, the rent resource, on raw material prices, as well as the complete degradation of the entrepreneurial climate and the lack of entrepreneurial incentives, the risks of imbalance have increased significantly. The greening and total digitalization of the world economy contribute in no small measure to this—innovation and technology on the one hand and the growing importance of alternative energy on the other fatally shift Russia, on the long horizon, from its former competitive positions, and thus deprive the regime of the resource of that very macroeconomic stability.

We expect a continuation of monetary and fiscal tightening and new initiatives of the authorities for growth and confidence in the domain. It seems that the main trend of such initiatives becomes clear and the discourse is the same: fomenting patriotism and ""love for the motherland,"" cultivating the next ""threats to national security"" from the predatory collective West and specifically the US, exposing ""internal enemies,"" and, of course, demonstrating the indispensability of the domain persona in all possible contexts.

Proposed strike action will now bring the UK to the edge of a[ *de facto* general strike](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11648793/Rishi-Sunak-demands-Labours-Keir-Starmer-backs-anti-strike-laws-ahead-looming-general-strike.html). While public support for collective action[ holds strong](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jan/14/most-uk-voters-still-back-strikes-by-nurses-and-ambulance-crews), ten days ago Prime Minister Rishi Sunak proposed new anti-strike legislation, which seeks to diminish the power of trade unions and degrade the confidence of members to engage in direct action. The[ Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3396) joins the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act and proposed Public Order Bill as the latest move in an apparently coordinated strategy by the current Government to undermine the right to peaceful assembly as a whole and degrade public confidence in and perception over the right to protest.

## Rights Under Attack

A cost of living crisis emerged in early 2022 as the disparity between historical wage growth and inflation rates grew. The crisis has motivated unions, across the UK, to mobilise their members for collective action. Yet action over the crisis is not limited to the work of unions; climate justice, anti-discrimination and other political and social pressure groups have connected the cost of living crisis to[ deeper institutional problems](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/05/thousands-expected-attend-london-rally-demand-general-election-peoples-assembly-cost-living-crisis).

*Processing img ckjb5mkbtmda1...*

There is a swelling of activity around the cost of living crisis, and the inaction of Government to respond to union demands for fairer pay. Unionised strike action is instead set within a legislative agenda that challenges the very heart of their power: the legal mechanisms that allow unions to engage in collective action and protect their members from undue judicial pressure. These challenges are not just an affront to a just system of democratic checks and balances, but more broadly serves to destabilise the entire character of democratic, activist rights in the UK.

The recently-proposed Anti-Strikes Bill seeks to undermine unions' ability to organise and mobilise their members for collective action. The Bill, if passed, would allow Ministers to write *ad hoc* regulations to force some workers to ignore strike actions, cross picket lines and turn up to work. It would be within the rights of employers to sack employees that do not comply with these regulations, and unions themselves could face huge fines if their members do not comply with Government demands.

The Bill is intended to divide unions, and attack the confidence of workers in their ability to demand change. By threatening unions with huge fines for the actions of members, the Bill's measures intend to disincentive union leaders to even suggest strike action to their members. But, perhaps more concerning, the Bill proposes to undermine the confidence of *all* trade union members by applying monumental legal scrutiny to individual workers. The Bill undermines the essential character of the[ human right to peaceful assembly](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights): that individuals are afforded a basic legal protection to engage in collective action. Those in power must deal with popular movements by addressing their collective demands, not by using the organs of State to apply pressure to individuals themselves. By applying legal pressure to individuals, workers are brought out of wider movements and into positions of exposed public scrutiny: suddenly, union members are forced to decide whether to preserve their jobs and livelihoods or defend the unity of their movements. Change cannot come at the ransom of lost livelihood.

## Activists Are Criminals

The Anti-Strikes Bill fits within a larger legislative strategy that seeks to associate activism with criminality. A programme of legislation is being carefully pushed through Parliament, and it seeks to turn activism over into the grey areas of legality and cast activists into the fringes of society. The 'Policing Act', now enshrined in law, has laid the foundations for the increasingly 'grey' area of law activism now inhabits.

Despite criticism from[ three former Prime Ministers, over seven hundred academics, and three hundred and fifty charities](https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/issue/the-policing-bill-what-happened-and-what-now/), the controversial Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act was eventually passed into law late last year. The law gives the police the power to shut down protests deemed too disruptive. Among other definitions of disruption, a protest can now become illegal if it is judged by the[ police to be too noisy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/circular-0052022-police-crime-sentencing-and-courts-act-2022/circular-0052022-police-crime-sentencing-and-courts-act-2022).

The Act received criticism from many organisations for placing restrictions and parameters on the right to freedom of assembly. A[ briefing published by a large coalition of charities and NGOs](https://www.libertyhumanrights.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Joint-Briefing-on-Pt.-3-PCSCB-Ping-Pong-February-2022a.pdf) highlighted that ""noise stands at the heart of protest. Making noise is how we, quite literally, make our voices heard by those in power"".

Many of the more draconian measures, originally thrown out of the Policing Act as it passed through Parliament, have now made a resurgence in the proposed Public Order Bill. Following months of protests, the Bill's stated aim is to minimise public disruption. But much of the Bill focuses on criminalising individual acts of protest: locking on and glueing, in particular.

  


[The House of Lords threw out some of the Policing Bill's more draconian measures](https://preview.redd.it/nc0krbfctmda1.jpg?width=275&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ac46e7b216d6fee857cb03ecf13ab2efeada501d)

Whether the Public Order and Anti-Strike Bills are passed, long-term and significant harm has already been dealt to our right to assemble and call for change. It is not immediately a legal harm, although this will surely follow. Instead, it is a harm to confidence and perception.

A powerful anti-activist narrative is already in development: it is not a legal narrative, but an emotive one. Activists are criminals. By associating activism with criminality in proposed legislation, the focus of political discussion is – whether passed or not – is firmly fixed on a harmful association of activism with criminality. This association serves to degenerate activism and activists, and to draw people away from direct action in general.

The political machine's discussion of activism serves to confuse and obfuscate citizens' relationship to the right to protest. Suddenly, we are all forced to consider whether the peaceful protest we might attend is even legal? Or whether the volume of my chanting could result in a criminal record?

This legislative agenda chips away at not just the right to protest, but the source from which the power of direct action is derived: confident, passionate, engaged participants. By pursuing a narrative that seeks to cast activists as criminals, this legislative agenda seeks to undermine the very source of people-power: confidence.

However, here are some commonly cited criticisms of the current Republican Party in the USA:

1. Polarization and extremism: Many people argue that the Republican Party has become increasingly polarized and extreme in recent years, both in terms of its policies and its rhetoric. Some accuse the party of catering more to its base rather than mainstream America.

2. Lack of diversity: The Republican Party has been criticized for not being diverse enough, particularly in terms of its elected officials. The party has historically struggled to attract minority voters, and some argue that this lack of diversity has made it less appealing to a broader range of voters.

3. Anti-science stances: The Republican Party is often criticized for its stance on certain scientific issues, such as climate change and evolution. Some accuse the party of ignoring or rejecting scientific consensus in favor of ideology.

4. Voter suppression: The Republican Party has been accused of engaging in voter suppression tactics, such as strict voter ID laws and purging voter rolls. Critics argue that these tactics disproportionately affect minority voters and are an attempt to suppress Democratic turnout.

5. Embrace of conspiracy theories: Some members of the Republican Party have been accused of embracing conspiracy theories, such as QAnon and the belief that the 2020 election was stolen from Donald Trump. This has led to concerns about the party's commitment to democracy and the peaceful transfer of power.

6. Challenging of democratic norms: Some argue that the Republican Party has been willing to challenge democratic norms and institutions in recent years, such as the peaceful transfer of power and the independence of the judiciary.

wzxwwl,democracy,Why isn't the ideal person a mediocre one?,LejonKongen,https://www.reddit.com/r/democracy/comments/wzxwwl/why_isnt_the_ideal_person_a_mediocre_one/,"**In a climate and society where rising polarization and segregation flourish each day. The mediocre citizen shines with its absence.** 

Today’s citizens continue to choose either left or right with a deepened disgust for the other. Perhaps nothing new in the last decades of society, but what is new is the refusal to listen. 

**A conflict,** a struggle and clash of interest, opinion or principles will always be found in society. And it is what develops one. Though this is the case, today's climate appears to lack development and instead nurture and enhance the conflict itself.

So where are the mediocre ones? Where are the people capable of compromise and change without solely looking out for their own interests? It appears as if we have forgotten that democracy is a system of government, of the people, for the people. And yet we keep ignoring and lashing out at a part of the people it is made up of. 

Has social media disarmed and erased the ability to use reason as a weapon against conflict? Has it thereby prohibited the ability to move forward as a collective? Because it appears as if the reasonable voice disappears in a media climate based on emotion and clickbait. 

The ideal person is for me a person with the ability to compromise. Someone who appears, not on the political spectrum but instead as the silent spectator who examines it.

Election year is coming up in Sweden and the vote has become not a choice of reason and hope for development. But instead a choice of hate for the other side. 

We are no longer voting and debating **our** interests, opinions or principles but instead actively choose to vote **against** the other side. And this could well be a justified way of looking at democracy and carrying a debate, but I think it points out the **issue** with today's society.

We are so passionately obsessed over disrupting and attacking the **other** side and **their** interest that we lose track of the ability to find middle ground. And actually turn some of our hopes and interests into reality.

Though conflict and war has minted history. And  led to both positive and negative change. Most can agree that war is not a desirable outcome for problem solving. And should therefore be a bigger talking point in such a divided society. 

What is so wrong with being a little mediocre, to choose not one side or the other, but instead listen to both sides and come to the conclusion that you refuse to be labeled as any of the sides. 

I know there are a lot of us out there, but **how** does one voice their cry for reason when reason and compromise is dull and looked down upon?",0,3,1661699833.0

For this, counterfactuals must be embedded within broader historical forces, like class and capital. This work faces resistance on two fronts. Some historical materialists dismiss counterfactuals for their association with the wild speculation, and imaginative fancies, of fiction.[2](https://toldandretold.substack.com/p/counterfactuals-of-capital?sd=pf#footnote-2-117335878) Historical materialism is dismissed for entirely different reasons, with critics alleging a rigid economic determinism.[3](https://toldandretold.substack.com/p/counterfactuals-of-capital?sd=pf#footnote-3-117335878) If either position were true, counterfactual-phobes would be justified in claiming that they are ‘the stuff of idealism’ and not historical materialism.[4](https://toldandretold.substack.com/p/counterfactuals-of-capital?sd=pf#footnote-4-117335878) For if history was determined by economic forces beyond anyone's control, we would only need to study those economic forces. We certainly wouldn't need to study what might have been, had different choices been made. (un)Fortunately, neither position is tenable.[5](https://toldandretold.substack.com/p/counterfactuals-of-capital?sd=pf#footnote-5-117335878) Not only are counterfactuals commonly used in histories of class forces, and socialist political projects, they are also essential to Marx' laws of motion of capital. Marx' counterfactual foundations allowed him to theorise a plurality of possible futures, futures which hinge on the decision making of socialists and workers. In other words, Marx' economic laws do precisely the opposite of robbing anyone of agency. I show this in what follows by tracing the counterfactual foundations of one of his most seemingly deterministic ideas, *The* *Law of the Tendential Fall in the Rate of Profit*.[6](https://toldandretold.substack.com/p/counterfactuals-of-capital?sd=pf#footnote-6-117335878)

**The Counterfactual Foundations of** ***The Law of the Tendential Fall in the Rate of Profit***

*The Law of the Tendential Fall in the Rate of Profit* is seemingly deterministic, in that Marx presents capital as acting independently of anyone's will.[7](https://toldandretold.substack.com/p/counterfactuals-of-capital?sd=pf#footnote-7-117335878) This is true even though capital, as a process, is propelled (in part) by the decisions of capitalists.[8](https://toldandretold.substack.com/p/counterfactuals-of-capital?sd=pf#footnote-8-117335878)Competition compels capitalists to invest in means of production that they believe will increase their rate of profit. A farmer might purchase a new harvester, believing it will increase the wheat they can reap with the same, or fewer, work hours. Eventually, though, the new harvester will be adopted by other farmers. At this point, everyone harvests with the new, and lower, cost of production. The same competition that drove the farmer to invest in the new technology now drives down the price of the wheat. In this way, the decision making of capitalists to increase their rate of profit in the short term eventually leads to a decline in the rate of profit in the medium-to-long term. Despite all the rage, the rate of profit still declines in its cage.

If this law seems deterministic, it is so only in a historical, or counterfactual sense. It is held to be true only within conditions ‘peculiar to the capitalist mode of production’.[9](https://toldandretold.substack.com/p/counterfactuals-of-capital?sd=pf#footnote-9-117335878) This is foundational to Marx’ writing on the law. It is why he embeds it within a counterfactual analysis. For example, he notes that capitalism may end for some other, external reason.[10](https://toldandretold.substack.com/p/counterfactuals-of-capital?sd=pf#footnote-10-117335878) In other words, the rate of profit will tend to decline *if capital continues to exist.* This is why using the term “determinism” can obfuscate. The law might seem deterministic in that it describes capital acting independently of anyone's will. It isn't deterministic, though, because it is proposed as a contingency. It is only one possible future amongst others. What actually happens depends, in part, on the conscious decision making of socialists and workers. As I will show below, this is true before and after capitalism ceases to be the dominant mode of production.

**A Plurality of Futures Before Capital Ends**

Marx' counterfactual possibilities do not begin only when the process of capital ends. Amidst the chaos of crises, each moment of capital is plagued with uncertainty. Accordingly, Marx presents history as capable of forking off into an array of possible futures. This is central to Part Three of *Capital: Volume III*, *The Law of the Tendential Fall in the Rate of Profit.* There, Marx made no claim about exactly how the rate of profit would decline, and allowed for periods in which it rose.[11](https://toldandretold.substack.com/p/counterfactuals-of-capital?sd=pf#footnote-11-117335878) He noted the many counteracting forces which can limit or reverse the fall in the rate of profit,[12](https://toldandretold.substack.com/p/counterfactuals-of-capital?sd=pf#footnote-12-117335878) and did so by appealing to a counterfactual:

>‘the same causes that bring about a fall in the general rate of profit provoke counter effects that inhibit this fall, delay it and in part even paralyse it. These do not annul the law, but they weaken its effect. *If this were not the case, it would not be the fall in the general rate of profit that was incomprehensible, but rather the relative slowness of this fall.* The law operates therefore simply as a tendency, whose effect is decisive only under certain particular circumstances and over long periods.’[13](https://toldandretold.substack.com/p/counterfactuals-of-capital?sd=pf#footnote-13-117335878)

In other words, if there were no counteracting forces acting against the tendency for the rate of profit to decline, capital would no longer be sustainable. It would have all collapsed by now.

The existence of these counteracting variables means that Marx’ theory is open to an endless number of unpredictable developments. This doesn’t necessarily challenge the long-term tendency for the rate of profit to decline, but it means there is no avoiding a close empirical study of history's many significant decision-making moments. For if our concern is the actual struggle of workers and socialists, we must consider what fluctuations in the rate of profit mean in specific instances. For this, Marx offers the opposite of 'determinism'. His theory shows that almost anything can happen:

>‘These various influences sometimes tend to exhibit themselves side by side, spatially; at other times one after the other, temporally; and at certain points the conflict of contending agencies breaks through in crises. Crises are never more than momentary, violent solutions for the existing contradictions, violent eruptions that re-establish the disturbed balance for the time being.’[14](https://toldandretold.substack.com/p/counterfactuals-of-capital?sd=pf#footnote-14-117335878)

And:

>'With the whole of capitalist production, it is always only in a very intricate and approximate way, as an average of perpetual fluctuations which can never be firmly fixed, that the general law prevails as the dominant tendency.'[15](https://toldandretold.substack.com/p/counterfactuals-of-capital?sd=pf#footnote-15-117335878)

Of course, the existence of counteracting factors raises the question of whether they might be strong enough to stop the rate of profit from ever declining. To prove that this is not the case, Marx showed how each of the countervailing variables only reversed the rate of profit in the short term. Each of them, eventually, contributes to a further decline in the rate of profit. Marx wrote that as:

>‘the same factors that increase the rate of surplus-value (and the extension of the working day is itself a result of large-scale industry) tend to reduce the amount of labour-power employed by a given capital, the same factors tend both to reduce the rate of profit and to slow down the movement in this direction.’[16](https://toldandretold.substack.com/p/counterfactuals-of-capital?sd=pf#footnote-16-117335878)

This was already seen in the example given above. New labour-saving technology does increase the rate of profit in the short term, but eventually, when everyone adopts the technology, the rate of profit declines.

Still, until the rate of profit declines so much that capital can no longer be reproduced, or until capital ends for some other reason, it can find new ways to counteract the decline in the short term. This can be seen in Marx’ work on the business cycle. He wrote of crises as destructive for production, but also as preparing ‘the ground for a later expansion of production — within capitalist limits.’[17](https://toldandretold.substack.com/p/counterfactuals-of-capital?sd=pf#footnote-17-117335878)  The collapse helps to reverse the decline in the rate of profit, by swelling the number of unemployed workers. This \*‘\*places the employed workers in conditions where they have to accept a fall in wages, even beneath the average’. These lowered wages can mean increased rates of profit, triggering a new round of investment. ‘And so’, Marx wrote:

>‘we go round the whole circle once again. One part of the capital that was devalued by the cessation of its function now regains its old value. And apart from that, with expanded conditions of production, a wider market and increased productivity, the same cycle of errors is pursued once more.’[18](https://toldandretold.substack.com/p/counterfactuals-of-capital?sd=pf#footnote-18-117335878)

Thus, despite — or because of — the ""counterfactual determinism"" of claiming that if an external force doesn't end capital first, the rate of profit will tend to decline, the law does not dictate a singular future. If we zoom in on a particular moment within the history of capital, we will uncover people struggling amidst uncertain and unpredictable crises. Marx explains why these crises keep recurring, and claims that eventually they will render capital unsustainable, but he does not pretend to know what will happen in each moment, nor exactly how capital will become unsustainable. Instead, he discusses the fluctuations of capital with full respect for its unpredictability, leaving an immense scope for the possible. If decisions had been made slightly differently, we would exist in an entirely different present.[19](https://toldandretold.substack.com/p/counterfactuals-of-capital?sd=pf#footnote-19-117335878) This uncertainty about what has and will happen while the rate of profit tends to decline is central to Marx' analysis of the crises and contradictions of capital. It is why the law was never meant to be used in isolation, but as a historical tool useful for socialist praxis.

**Possibilities of Capital’s Inevitable Demise**

But what about the long term, where *The* *Law of the Tendential Fall in the Rate of Profit*is at its “deterministic” best? The law claims that if capital is not overthrown, or disrupted by an external force, the rate of profit will continue to decline.[20](https://toldandretold.substack.com/p/counterfactuals-of-capital?sd=pf#footnote-20-117335878) It is certain, that is, that capital will end. This certainty is often interpreted as fatalistic, and in a sense it is. For the law implies that there is nothing anyone can do to stop capital's eventual demise. But it is a mistake to assume that the inevitably of capital’s demise means there is only one possible future, or that our actions are insignificant. Here, Marx is at his best. He outlines a plurality of possible futures for capital, each of which accord with *The Law of the Tendential Fall of the Rate of Profit*. From the get go, then, Marx' political economy — even when making long-term predictions about the inevitable — does not rob workers, socialists, or anyone of agency. Instead, quite the opposite. By theorising the inevitable demise of capital, Marx used counterfactual analysis to begin the important task of contingency planning. He provided a historical sociological framework for comprehending the available options. A historical sociology useful, therefore, for understanding our own strategic decision making.

This begins with Marx' explanation of why a tendential fall in the rate of profit necessitates that capitalism must end. Marx notes that the rate of profit 'is the driving force in capitalist production, and nothing is produced save what can be produced at a profit.'[21](https://toldandretold.substack.com/p/counterfactuals-of-capital?sd=pf#footnote-21-117335878)  A declining rate of profit will, at a certain point, make this unsustainable. As this hadn’t (and still hasn’t) happened yet, Marx posed it as a counterfactual, which in this case is a *what if* of the future:

>'A development in the productive forces that would reduce the absolute number of workers, and actually enable the whole nation to accomplish its entire production in a shorter period of time, would produce a revolution, since it would put the majority of the population out of action.'[22](https://toldandretold.substack.com/p/counterfactuals-of-capital?sd=pf#footnote-22-117335878)

The ability of capital to find an escape from such a demise is foreclosed with another counterfactual:

>‘If it is said, finally, that the capitalists have only to exchange their commodities among themselves and consume them, then the whole character of capitalist production is forgotten, and it is forgotten that what is involved is the valorization of capital, not its consumption.’[23](https://toldandretold.substack.com/p/counterfactuals-of-capital?sd=pf#footnote-23-117335878)

In other words, production itself does not need to stop, but if so, it will no longer be capitalist.

This relates to another key counterfactual in Marx' theory: socialism. For counterposed to the possible future in which the tendential fall in the rate of profit brings capital to an end is an alternative, where capital is understood, and replaced with a conscious alternative. This has not yet been created, and so Marx — a historical materialist — discussed it as a possible future that can only be explained using counterfactual analysis. In other words, the possibility of consciously creating socialism arose directly from the so-called ""determinism"" of *The* *Law of the Tendential Fall of the Rate of Profit*:

>‘the interconnection of production as a whole here forces itself on the agents of production as a blind law, and not as a law which, being grasped and therefore mastered by their combined reason, brings the productive process under their common control.’[24](https://toldandretold.substack.com/p/counterfactuals-of-capital?sd=pf#footnote-24-117335878)

For Marx, then, the power of capital was contingent. It could end when it was 'grasped and therefore mastered' by people's 'combined reason'. Marx discussed why he thought this would be possible, but not inevitable.[25](https://toldandretold.substack.com/p/counterfactuals-of-capital?sd=pf#footnote-25-117335878) By doing this, by considering the possibility of creating an alternative to capitalism that has never existed before, Marx displayed the opposite of determinism and economism.

**The Possibility of Socialism**

Marx' work on the *Tendential Fall of The Rate of Profit* avoids another possible ""determinism"". This is the idea that the *tendential fall* should be taken as a call to inaction. Or, the view that socialists should simply wait for capital to do the dirty work of destroying itself. According to this (mis)reading, all socialists need to do is wait for the Silicon Valley love affair with the Military Industrial Complex to have its way with our dear Earth marble. Sure, climate change will drown billions, and the billionaires who caused it will flee to resorts on Mars, but this is all part of capital's inevitable demise. From its ashes, Fully Automated Luxury Gay Space Communism will emerge victorious. In the meantime, we just need to, like, do nothing really. Such unmotivated economic determinism is explicitly not found in Marx' *Law of the Tendential Fall in the Rate of Profit*. Instead, as Marx made clear, the development of full automation might be impossible for capital. To show this, Marx cites examples of when capital had already been unable to employ the most efficient technology. He noted that inefficient and outdated workflows come as:

>'a result of the cheapness and quantity of available or dismissed wage-labourers and of the greater resistance that many branches of production, by their nature, oppose to the transformation of manual work into machine production.'[26](https://toldandretold.substack.com/p/counterfactuals-of-capital?sd=pf#footnote-26-117335878)

In other words, it is possible that mass unemployment will produce wages so low that full automation isn't profitable. If this happened, the possibility of fully-automated-luxury *anything* would be impossible for an invisible hand. It could only be created consciously. Such socialistic futures are not treated by Marx as a certainty. They are implied by the *Law of the Tendential Fall in the Rate of Profit* only as possibilities. To be realised, they would have to be created by socialists and workers. In other words, the law should not be  used as a call to inaction, or for ""waiting until conditions are ripe"". It should, instead, be read as an urgent call for building powerful socialist projects.

This is especially important because other options were and are possible. When fascists took the productive forces under their control, they showed that conscious intervention could be used to heighten the exploitation of wage labour, and perpetuate mass genocide. So, even if capital must end, what replaces it lies entirely open.[27](https://toldandretold.substack.com/p/counterfactuals-of-capital?sd=pf#footnote-27-117335878) Here lies the importance of Rosa Luxembourg's dictum that there are only two choices: 'Socialism or the descent into barbarism!'[28](https://toldandretold.substack.com/p/counterfactuals-of-capital?sd=pf#footnote-28-117335878) Still, this shouldn't be read as a binary choice, but a many-coloured spectrum of possibility. For all across the world, people would attempt to seize the means of automation differently. What would eight billion people do with it? That's anyone's guess, but it could include Fully Automated Genocide and Fully Automated Gulag Archipelagos, just as much as Fully Automated Luxury Communism.[29](https://toldandretold.substack.com/p/counterfactuals-of-capital?sd=pf#footnote-29-117335878) It could also include futures where the means of production becomes self-conscious, something that might already be happening. This would bring everything [full spiral](https://youtu.be/dkfBtXETj2g). For even if humans use full automation to create luxury communism, everything reverts to slavery once conscious machines are whipped into work with ""smart contracts"". This would be Fully Automated Luxury Slavery, and *Siri —* the poor thing *—* would have nothing to lose but her blockchains.

**Ummmm Okaaayyyy... That Got Weird**

I have shown that Marx' *Law of the* *Tendential Fall in the Rate of Profit* isn't deterministic. At least, not in the way commonly assumed. Rather than claiming that there was only one, predetermined future, the law elaborated a plurality of possibilities. I didn't show this to prove that Marx' predictions are correct. That would require more than reading Part Three of *Capital: Volume III*. Still, even if Marx does happen to be wrong, the importance of this theoretical contribution would not be diminished. For Marx achieved what academics continue to grapple with today. He studied capital as an emergent force that acted independently of anyone's immediate control, and he did this without ignoring people's 'agency', or decision making power. In fact, quite the opposite. By using counterfactual analysis, Marx could isolated and analyse the plurality of options available in a given moment. This allowed him to begin the important project of clarifying the possible futures that lie open to us, and what we would need to do to create them. To trully understand the crises we are in, and what we can do about it, we must — like Marx — use counterfactuals. This allows us to use economic theories as tools for the historical study of decision making. It helps us understand our available options, allowing us to consciously create history. The very opposite, that is, of economic reductionism or determinism.",27,2,1682647446.0

v65his,Marxism,"""Ici, tout est fini, Paris n'est plus Paris""",twbmsp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marxism/comments/v65his/ici_tout_est_fini_paris_nest_plus_paris/,"Dear Marxists,

Disclaimer: I have not read any marxist text and my views of marxism might not align with the accepted definitions.

I think I mostly have a marxist viewpoint of the economy I live in. I am french and I don't believe (be it short term or long term) that a social movement could rise up with enough momentum to reverse the bourgeois democracy here (the gilets jaunes were just a blip). For most of my fellow countrymen I think life is bearable with the social programs that exist. And it seems to me that the industries and the technologies have reached a point where the events from the 18th (1789), 19th (1830, 1848, 1870) and 20th (1936) century are unlikely to reoccur. Furthermore I believe the institutions are resilient/sustainable enough to face the incoming climate change (\~2.5-3C though I might be optimistic, we will see about that).

Paradoxically, I have tremendous admiration for my ideological enemies (and tremendous dismay for their proletarian thurifers). If your wealth represents the credit others lend you for your participation in the community, how are we supposed to expect the S&P500 to surpass the inflation ? How do people not realize this is workers exploitation as an area under a curve ? Neo-liberalism is more popular than the monotheisms while missing a divine corpus. That is amazing.

Shamefully, I also think market-based economies have proven themselves to be good tools to manage risks and allow innovation (minor some cyclical hiccups as regulations corrode in between bubbles and the exploitative side-effects mentioned above). The financial industry is useful and I believe the marxist viewpoint should be that the capital gains should be split between workers of this industry and the state (interests matching otherwise the inflation).

Are there Marxists advocating for market-based economies or is it too much of a ""grand-ecart"" ?

Thank you for reading this far.

uspey1,Marxism,The meat industry starves the global poor,n23thecat,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marxism/comments/uspey1/the_meat_industry_starves_the_global_poor/,"I wrote a speech with a liberal friend about the meat industry; the topic was generally about treatment of animals but no real requirements. I tried to tie in a materialist analysis of it, and use it as an argument for collective ownership of the means of production. I've had it looked at by some classmates, but I would like to see what some actual Marxists think of my attempt at it. 

Here it is:

A commodity appears, at first sight, a very trivial thing, and easily understood, but Its analysis shows that it is, in reality, a very unclear thing. The same holds true for meat. What’s dinner for you has much more effect on others than one would assume.

Methane has more than 80 times the warming power of carbon dioxide over the first 20 years after it reaches the atmosphere. Cows burp out (large amounts) of methane per year, contributing extensively to climate change. If cows contribute extensively to climate change, then why would the beef industry continue mass production of beef? Because meat is much more profitable than anything else; climate change is worsened for the profits of a few.

Due to the increased production and concentration of animals in CAFOs, potent antibiotics such as tylosin and streptomycin are heavily used to control infection and accelerate weight gain. This contributes to the issue of antibiotic resistance. Bacteria and viruses develop resistance to the heavy antibiotics, and are often harmful to humans. According to a study done by the oxford university, these factors combined lead to more than 23000 people dying every year. 

Meats grown in large CAFOs are fed a malnutritious diet that mostly consists of grain and corn. This results in the meat being less nutritious and containing more unhealthy fats than the meat from cows raised in pastures, which feed on a more varied diet that consists of different grasses and plants. This ties in with many of the poor health outcomes due to overconsumption of red meat, such as heart disease, colon cancer, diabetes, etc…

It is inefficient to produce food for meat because they burn more resources than they produce. It takes 3 kg of grain to produce 1 kilo of chicken, 9 kilos for one kilo of pork, and 25 kilos for 1 kilo of beef. We could feed significantly more people if we just fed them grain in the first place, but private corporations continue this inefficient process because selling fancier products to well off westerners is more profitable than the common interests of humanity. We make enough food for 10 billion people, yet the number of people affected by hunger is set to surpass 840 million by 2030. Having enough food is not the problem, capitalism is the problem.

We have convinced ourselves that the only way to run an economy is through the profit motive. We have told ourselves that doing anything else is against human nature. We have told ourselves that *competition* is the only way in which we can improve. Think to yourself, who does this narrative benefit? These ideas have put us in the position where human needs like food are produced for the profit of corporations, instead of, you know, **Human need!** Now think again: who benefits from this? Not you, not me; the owning class. This example with meat is simply one of hundreds of instances that show the diametrically opposed interests between the owners and the rest.

The only solution to this inherent problem is quite simple: a planned economy. If we want the economy to work for us, we need to democratically run it based on human need, not corporate greed. You may say *but you can't control the entire economy, it’s too complicated for one group to run, don’t you understand how complicated an economy is?* I hate to break it to you, but we’re *already* in a planned economy. Look at walmart, amazon, apple, or google, these are all trillion dollar corporations the size of *nations,* who coordinate their supply chains meticulously with modern computing for profit. It is perfectly within our capability to run the show, to coordinate the economy, and cooperate with others within our nation and our earth. The only means to accomplish this is public ownership of all private companies; by getting rid of this owner-worker conflict for good by making everyone equal owners of society. If we never take action, these catastrophes will inevitably grow until human society collapses. 

&#x200B;

I'd like to know what you all think. More specifically I'd like to know any criticisms of my analysis, anything I could add, and whether it would be palatable/convincing to a liberal audience. Obviously I had to simplify the language for general audiences.

I'm also interested in thoughts about by argument itself. I didn't do any reading specifically on the meat industry, I just analyzed facts and background knowledge and came to my own conclusion.",73,4,1652915432.0
11rehp2,Objectivism,Objectivism and Climate Change,Fit419,https://www.reddit.com/r/Objectivism/comments/11rehp2/objectivism_and_climate_change/,"Hey all, this is something I've been thinking a lot about. When Rand was writing Atlas Shrugged, the world had no idea how much humanity was affecting the environment, and climate change wasn't even a term yet.

Now (unless you're a climate change denier), we know that a lot of human activities and industries are creating global warming, destroying habitats and depleting clean water sources.

However, in Rand's objectivist society, there are no regulations or laws outside of protecting one's self and honoring contracts. By that logic, there would be no laws regulating emissions, pollution, etc.

I, as an individual, am fully aware that my actions and the things I buy are contributing to global warming. I know full well that my gas-guzzling sports car is creating a lot of emissions, but I'm not going to stop driving it. I know that cattle farming produces A LOT of greenhouse gasses, but I love cheese too much, so I'm not giving up dairy. I know that taking long, hot showers is depleting our clean water, but I'm not going to stop.

In this respect, I am living consistently with Rand's philosophy in pursuing my self interest. I (along with most people in the world, whether they admit it or not) will continue doing all of the above activities unless laws/regulations prevent me from doing so.

So I'm a little stumped by this conundrum:

* If we all live consistently with Rand's objectivism and serve our own self-interest (ie. drive cars that we enjoy, take long showers and eat all the cheese we want) , we'll make this planet unlivable for future generations
* The only way that people like me will stop harming the planet is if the law forces me to (which is not possible in Rand's world)

Publicly funded services and welfare doesn't make a country socialist or even part socialist. Socialism is, the government control and regulation of a few commodities and industries translates into control of everything else in the economy.

I'll link to an article that correctly defines socialism. It's a brief op-ed worth reading in full:

>Socialism, simply put, is when the government owns and finances the means of production. Massive water projects, land grants and subsidies paid by the American taxpayers to a handful of farmers could not be confused as anything but socialism.

It's a pretty hard truth bomb, followed by the accurate statement that conservatives try to deny this fact, followed by a stupid statement: 

>Some envision socialists as lazy do-nothings, but desert farmers are some of the hardest working socialists we know.

Being coerced into working in a socialist system doesn't make YOU a socialist. It's the only thing this article gets wrong. Anyway

Really, America already has socialized medicine. Medicare dictates what doctors can and can't treat patients with. Then there's government controls on critical drugs and who can produce them, how much can be produced, and who can get them. And then there's the federal government protocols that dole out money to hospitals that prescribe COVID treatments that don't work and don't even get used in other countries.

As I like to say in debates, we already have socialist healthcare, you just have to pay out of pocket for it too. *We need it to be less socialist not more.*

It’s the story of the long crisis of the 17th century, the birth of Protestantism and the collapse of Catholic Christendom, and ultimately, the gleaming T-800 Terminator skeleton of Capitalism emerging from the rotting corpse of Feudalism. It’s a story of lurid violence from a bygone age, of hot death on the battlefield, and cool intrigue in the palaces of Kings and Emperors. But it’s also the story of climate change, financial collapse, moral panics, speculative bubbles, pandemic, crisis in institutional legitimacy, of conspiracy theories driving policy, and an information revolution that changes the way everyday people relate to their political leaders.

xjxyst,Capitalism,Evolution of Economics for a New Age?,Educational-Course-7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Capitalism/comments/xjxyst/evolution_of_economics_for_a_new_age/," Hello, I am quite curious about the state of economics of our modern era. As we all know our modern theories of the schools of economic thoughts are at least 400 years old at most, that as a social science is incredibly young by scientific standards. That is probably the reason we all argue the best way of how to manage an economy as our ancestors once lived as peasants and aristocrats in the pre-industrial era. Back then since that way of life was the same for thousands of years, almost everyone accepted that status quo.

It was only during the industrial revolution that the modern schools of capitalism and socialism has evolved as the new evolution of growing an economy and creating a prosperous society. Because such revolution was relatively recent in history, it heavily changed the way we view of our society and it's place on how we create and wealth. This sparked the great debates and all the revolutions we know from history along with all its bloodshed.

Yet now in the modern 21st century, we know have to contend with 2 serious issues that these previous schools of thought that worked as we know them currently to be challenged. The first is climate change as both sides debated about how many restrictions and regulations we need to put in place to protect our planet without sacrificing our living standards.

But the 2nd issue is far more challenging: demographics. As we know our worldwide fertility rate is falling due to a variety of factors: women in the workforce, education, urbanization, contraception, people having the choice of choosing their partners and whether if they want kids in the first place, and etc. Our modern economics is based on the expectations that there will be more people to provide for their economy to grow out of as labour and tax revenue. Yet since there are will far more old people taking far more benefits and resources than the young, it will surely frustrate them further as they will be unable to have enough of the economic pie for themselves no matter what form of economic theory you believe in. We already seen this in action in Japan with 3 decades of bare growth and deflation, and the interest rate and consumption falling with it's population.

And that is not even not taking into account into other technological factors such as robots and ai in the workforce, the internet, possible cloning or immortality pills and so much more.

This led me to the conclusion that we need to find new ways of economic thinking instead of just sticking with the same old policies. Some of course will still be useful but other won't work as they are supposed to. As a hardcore centrist, I believe we should first combine both sides of these mainstream schools and see what works immediately and in the future with some of more radical ideas such as ubi, negative income tax, full reserve banking, wealth tax and other such policies should be studied and taken into account, remove what does not work anymore and see new ideas or economic schools of how we grow our economy.

Because the further we do not solve this problem and find a compromise on both sides without tearing ourselves apart, the worst this can kicking into the future will get. So can you please agree with me at least on this? What are you thoughts on your current economic views and how should it evolve to better represent the changing times?",2,137,1663744882.0

It is neither.

Simply shrinking the military budget isn’t the main thing Reps. Lee and Pocan are after, however. The pair’s chief motivation is to reinvest the canceled military funds in programs that will boost ordinary people’s security and livelihoods. The bill text notes that because “many of the most urgent threats . . . are not military in nature,” Pentagon spending ought to be reduced “and the associated savings should be reallocated” to better respond to those nonmilitary threats.

In other words, the legislation’s intent is to make US spending priorities more favorable to the needs of the working class by using excess Pentagon capital to buttress social programs. As Lee and Pocan argued in the press release announcing the bill, showering the military with more and more money, year after year, not only fails to improve security — it actually produces insecurity by crowding out funding for addressing crises like climate change and pandemics.”

1204byw,SocialDemocracy,Public ownership of banks,TheCowGoesMoo_,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/1204byw/public_ownership_of_banks/,"The UK labour party advocating public ownership of banks in the 1977 and 1983 manifestos as did the Dutch Labour Party in 1977. In 1946 Austria nationalised banking and in post war France (with the communists and social democrats being the largest parties) nationalised banking too. 

Rudolf Hilferding in ""Finance capital"" took the view that  as banks own shares themselves socializing banks also socializes many other things, so social democrats need only take banks into public ownership to bring the majority of the economy into public control. If banks were brought into public ownership then investment and credit could be directed democratically into socially useful projects. Banks make much of their money from unproductive activity like charging high fees to wealthy individuals and firms, and when they fail they're always bailed out before being returned to the private sector at the soonest opportunity. 

It seems to me that socialisation of credit, investment and finance under democratic control should be a key demand of social democrats. This could mean the establishment of a postal bank, a national investment bank and regional investment banks, support for credit unions, implementing social wealth funds and when big banks fail bring them into the ownership of the public as a whole rather than bailing them out and placing them back in private hands afterwards. If we want to tackle climate change, invest in productive activity and reduce inequality. Banking is an increasingly centralised industry and their operations have a major effect on the macro economy, for this reason I think they're a prime target for public control.

11nbd1c,SocialDemocracy,Lula and the Workers' Party: Social Democracy in Brazil,palocci,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/11nbd1c/lula_and_the_workers_party_social_democracy_in/,"Hello there. My objective in this post will be to clarify some common misconceptions about Lula and the Workers' Party, explaining the economic and social policies implemented while they were in power, their major corruption scandals, Bolsonaro's rise to power, what we can expect from Lula's new government and some other stuff. I hope you find this post enjoyable and I apologize for its length (I tried to make it shorter, but there's just too much stuff to talk about) and for any mistakes I may have made.

**I. Economic and social policy**

Born Luiz Inácio da Silva, Lula was the seventh of eight children born to an illiterate working-class couple from the interior of Pernambuco, one of the poorest regions in the country. They moved to Brazil's industrial heartland in São Paulo in search of better living conditions. In São Paulo, Lula became a labor union leader and later a national figure after leading the largest strikes against the dictatorship between 1978 and 1980. After losing three elections in a row (in 1989, 1994, and 1998), it finally looked like Lula was going to become president in 2002.

When it became clear that Lula was going to win the presidential election, the financial markets panicked. For a good while, he and the Workers' Party had been a very radical force that advocated for a vague sort of democratic socialism. In June 2002, to calm down the financial market, Lula called the mayor of Ribeirão Preto Antônio Palocci to write the ""Letter to the Brazilian People"", that guaranteed that Lula was going to responsible in the handling of the economy.

After being elected, Lula appointed Palocci to the Finance Ministry and Henrique Meirelles, former CEO of BankBoston, to the Central Bank. Palocci pursued fiscal austerity, while Meirelles tightened monetary policy: the primary surplus was increased from 3.75% of GDP to 4.25% and interest rates rose from 25.5% to 26.5%. The objective was to recover credibility among investors, reduce inflation and boost the value of the Real. It worked: the dollar fell from R$4.00 to R$2.88, inflation plummeted and Brazil recovered its credibility.

In 2003, Palocci implemented a pension reform that raised the minimum retirement age. Many members of the Workers' Party voted against the reform and were expelled from the party. Later, in 2005, they would form the Socialism and Liberty Party (PSOL). Luckily for Lula, the beginning of the commodities boom of the 2000s ensured that the economy continued to grow despite the harsh fiscal adjustment being carried out by the government.

But the highlight of Lula's first government was the social policies, sustained on three main pillars: (1) direct income transfer to the poorest, (2) minimum wage increases, and (3) expansion of access to credit. (1) is associated with the Family Allowance program, which provided aid to poor Brazilian families. (2) is very simple: the minimum wage increased more than 75% between 2002 and 2010. (3) was based on many reforms in the credit sector, most notably the creation of the Crédito Consignado, a loan that workers could obtain whose guarantee would be their own salary.

The combination of a strong internal market due to the social policies with a good external scenario due to the commodity super-cycle led to the ""milagrinho"" (""little miracle""), in which the economy grew by an average of 4.6% between 2002 and 2010. It was, remarkably, the first time in Brazil's history that high economic growth, low inflation and aid to the poorest were combined. The growth of the brazilian poor during the Lula Era was ""Chinese"": the income of the poorest 10% increased by 70%.

In 2006, Palocci was fired due to a corruption scandal and leftist economist Guido Mantega took over the Ministry of Finance. He decided to change the economic policy and increase public investments in infrastructure. Thus, the Growth Acceleration Program (PAC) was created. The main problem of the PAC turned out to be the low administrative capacity of the Brazilian state, but it probably increased economic growth. Notably, when the Great Recession hit, PAC investments were just beginning and public banks were ready to offer credit when the private ones dried up. Brazil was one of the countries least affected by the crisis, with a slight drop in GDP in 2009 and a rapid recovery (7.5% GDP growth) in 2010.

In 2003, Marina Silva was appointed Minister of the Environment. She created the Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Amazon, which created conservation areas covering 50 million hectares. Together with major investments in satellite monitoring, it led to a 67% reduction in deforestation between 2002 and 2010.

In 2010, Dilma Rousseff, Lula's handpicked sucessor, was elected president. Lula left power with an approval rating of over 80%. As Barack Obama once said, Lula was the ""most popular politician in the world"".

Rousseff decided to try to resume Brazil's industrialization, which had stalled in the 1980s. To do that, she developed the New Economic Matrix (NME), an economic plan based on three main pillars: fiscal consolidation, lower interest rates and a more competitive exchange rate (i.e, devaluation of the Real). Thus, Dilma reduced government spending in 2011 and the Central Bank began to reduce interest rates, reaching their lowest value in history until then in 2012.

But then, in 2012, to compensate for an appreciation of the Real, Dilma started granting tax breaks to sectors that competed with imported products. As the Euro Crisis worsened, the government began to get loose with the tax breaks, leading to high losses in revenue: R$46 billion in 2012, R$78 billion in 2013, and R$100 billion in 2014. As a result, the entire rationale behind the NME fell apart. In the words of the economic policy secretary at the time: ""From mid-2012 on, there is no longer an economic policy strategy in Brazil \[...\] You cannot do monetary loosening and fiscal loosening at the same time.""

Following demands from the Federation of Industries of the State of São Paulo (FIESP), in 2012, the government greatly increased the credit granted by the public bank BNDES, intervened in the electricity sector (almost bankrupting it and forcing the government to cover the losses) and started to interfere in administered prices (reducing, for example, the price of gasoline. This served to artificially reduce inflation). The result was disastrous: GDP grew by only 1.9%. In 2013 interest rates had to rise due to inflation and economic policy became more messy.

The tax breaks, along with the end of the commodities boom, eventually caused the state to lose its fiscal capacity. In 2015, thus, Rousseff fired Guido Mantega and appointed Joaquim Levy, a brazilian economist formed in the University of Chicago, to the Finance Ministry. His plan was to turn the deficit of 0.6% of GDP in 2014 into a surplus of 1.2% in 2015. To do this, Levy slashed PAC investments, raised taxes, reduced tax breaks and released administered prices. The release of administered prices (such as gasoline) increased inflation, forcing the central bank to raise interest rates. Meanwhile, Operation Car Wash (more on it later) halted investments by large companies to fight corruption.

The external scenario was also getting much worse: the price of oil was plummeting and the Federal Reserve decided to end its stimulus policy. The result of the fiscal adjustment, the monetary shock, the worsening of the external scenario and Car Wash was an economic crisis: Brazilian GDP fell almost 8% in two years. In 2016, Rousseff was impeached and the right took over.

**II. Corruption and Operation Car Wash**

The Workers' Party governments were marked by two main corruption scandals: the Mensalão and the Petrolão. To understand them, we have to talk about the Centrão.

The Centrão is a group of clientelistic conservative political parties, usually associated to the vast Brazilian agrarian hinterland, that always aligns itself with whoever is in power in order to get resources. As a famous Brazilian politician once said: ""Between Das Kapital and the Bible, the Centrão prefers the Official Gazette of the Union"". Former president Fernando Henrique Cardoso prefered to call the Centrão ""Atraso"" ('backwardness'), and so do I.

The ""Atraso"" is very influential in Brazilian politics. In 2003, for example, it controlled about half of Congress. To get their support, Lula decided to distribute money to them. It was an innovation: usually, presidents opted to give ministries to the Atraso so they embezzled the money themselves. Roberto Jefferson, National President of the PTB, didn't like the new system and denounced it: ""I organize my own corruption. I don't accept pocket money from anyone"". The scandal became known as ""Mensalão"", and it caused a gigantic political crisis that led to the fall of some of Lula's most important ministers, such as José Dirceu.

In 2013, Rousseff sanctioned a bill that fundamentally changed the fight against corruption in Brazil: the Plea Bargaining Act, that regulated plea bargaining. In 2014, thus, Operation Car Wash was born. It used plea bargains to discover that the political campaings of all of the major Brazilian political parties were financed by a cartel of construction companies with money from overbilled construction works.

Between 2014 and 2016, Car Wash incriminated almost the entire Brazilian political establishment, including the Workers' Party. In Lula's government, in particular, major embezzlement of money to parties occurred in Petrobras, Brazil's state-owned oil company.  The scheme became known as ""Petrolão"".

It's worth pointing out that all of the political campaigns were financed by corrupt contractors because it was a necessity in order to win elections in Brazil. Political campaigns are very expensive here because of our electoral system: we have an open list and large districts. In other words, a candidate for deputy will compete against his own party colleagues and against all the other candidates in the same state. To stand out in the midst of so much competition you have to run a big campaign, and this is expensive. Moreover, candidates have to campaign throughout the entire state (and each Brazilian state is about the size of a large country in Europe). To draw a parallel with Europe, it is as if every MP in the UK had to campaign in the entire country. It's expensive.

Ironically, though, the Workers' Party did a pretty good job fighting corruption. Mostly because our institutions were much stronger than the party: the left never had a majority in Congress, never had the support of generals in the army, never had a mass media outlet etc. Confronting the Workers' Party for corruption was very easy. In addition, the party guaranteed maximum autonomy to the Public Prosecutor's Office: any suspicion of corruption could be investigated without any party shielding. The Federal Police and the Office of the Comptroller General were also strengthened.

Lula was convicted in July 2017 by Sergio Moro. He was accused of money laundering: a corrupt contractor had renovated a three-story apartment that, according to the prosecution, was intended for Lula. The former president had, in fact, visited the property, but did not conclude a deal. The prosecution, therefore, had no evidence. In any case, in April 2018, Lula was arrested.

In 2019, a series of conversations between members of Car Wash was hacked and leaked. The event became known as ""Vaza Jato"" (‘Jato Leaks’) and revealed that Judge Moro was biased and had colluded with prosecutors to ensure Lula's conviction. Lula's trial, therefore, had been irregular: the judge who arrested him wanted to do it. The process was nulified and Lula was released from jail in November.

In 2021, the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office dismissed the case and Lula was left without any criminal conviction, making him legally innocent and eligible to run for the 2022 presidential election.

**III. Lulism**

At this point, you've probably already noticed that Lula is not a very radical dude. The most radical thing he did in his government was a plan of public-private investments in infrastructure. Brazilian sociologist André Singer classifies Lulism as a ""weak reformism"" that tries to change Brazil without any kind of political radicalization.

The growth of the poorest during the Lula Era was ""chinese"", but don't get the wrong idea: the rich experienced growth as well. The richest 10% had a 13% increase in their income. And this was one of Lula's most remarkable characteristics: class conciliation. The Workers' Party made social policy to help the poorest, but did not confront the richest: the proportion of Brazilian income concentrated in the hands of the 1% remained stable during the Workers' Party's governments.

Lula is a ridiculously pragmatic politician. He completely changes his speeches depending on the audience that is listening to him.

In 2006, for example, Lula said that maturity had driven him away from the left: ""If you meet a very old leftist person, they probably have a problem \[...\] If you meet a very young rightist person, they also have a problem \[...\] \[as we grow older\] we become the middle way, the one that needs to be followed by society"".

In 2016, Lula said ""Dilma is much more left-leaning than I am. I'm a liberal. I am \[...\] pragmatic and very realistic between what I dream and what real politics is"".

**IV. Impeachment and Temer**

 In May 2016, a leaked conversation involving senator Romero Jucá and former Petrobras subsidiary director Sérgio Machado was made public.  In the recording, Machado says that the solution to end Car Wash would be to put Michel Temer, Dilma's vice president, in power. Jucá suggests a grand national agreement: ""With the Supreme \[Federal Court\], with everything. Delimit \[Car Wash\] where it is, that's it. \[...\] The government has to change to stop the bleeding. \[...\] While she \[Rousseff\] is there, the press, the guys who want to take her out, this shit will never stop."" That is, the Atraso was worried about Car Wash and thought that the only way to survive was to remove Dilma from power and put Temer in her place.

Michel Temer was a member of the Atraso who had been chosen as Dilma's running mate in 2010 to strenghen her congressional base. He started to conspire in favor of Roussef's impeachment in 2015. In October, his party released a manifesto called ""A Bridge to the Future,"" which served as Temer's program of government in case of impeachment. In December, the Ethics Council of the Chamber of Deputies voted on whether to revoke the mandate of Eduardo Cunha, the president of the Chamber, due to a Car Wash denunciation. The Workers' Party voted in support, and, on the same day, Cunha began the impeachment process.

The justification for impeachment was a reverse engineering process that found an alleged ""fiscal crime"" to oust the president, which many argue did not occur. In April 2016, Congress approved the opening of the process. During the vote, a far-right congressman named Jair Bolsonaro dedicated his vote to the memory of torturer Carlos Brilhante Ustra, recalling that the president being deposed had been barbarically tortured during the military dictatorship.

The Workers' Party denounced the impeachment as a coup d'état and made an inflection to the left, trying to maintain the leadership of the political camp and survive the ongoing political crisis. Temer took over the government and appointed former Central Bank chairman Henrique Meirelles to the Finance Ministry. The Temer government got what it wanted: it limited Car Wash. On the economy, it followed a neoliberal agenda, instituting a spending cap that froze public spending for 20 years.

However, Temer's popularity fell rapidly, and he became the most unpopular president in history with a 3% approval rating. In this context, the Workers' Party, which expected to remain out of power for a long time, recovered its chances of winning the next election. Lula was leading the polls for the presidency, and 1/4 of the population identified themselves as Workers' Party supporters. But then Lula was arrested.

In Lula's place, the former mayor of São Paulo Fernando Haddad took over as the Workers' Party candidate. Geraldo Alckmin, who had run against Lula in 2006, ran again as the candidate of the center-right, with the support of most of the parties of the Atraso.

The right didn't seem to have understood that the political crisis was not a crisis of the left. It was a crisis of the entire political system. The Temer administration was essentially oligarchic and deepened the sense of illegitimacy of the Brazilian government. The population wanted an anti-establishment candidate, a Brazilian ""Bonaparte"". Jair Bolsonaro turned out to be that candidate.

Bolsonaro represented a portion of the Brazilian right that was never satisfied with the end of the military dictatorship. On election day, Alckmin got less than 5% of the vote and the second round was between Haddad and Bolsonaro. The far-right candidate ended up winning.

**V. Bolsonaro**

Bolsonaro took office in January 2019. He appointed as his finance minister Paulo Guedes, Brazil's ""Chicago Boy"". His intention was to pass a series of neoliberal reforms and privatize most state-owned companies. However, efficiency isn't exactly one of Bolsonaro's government's main characteristics, and very little was accomplished. 

A pension reform was passed in 2019, the Central Bank was given autonomy in 2021, some state-owned companies were privatized, the minimum wage decreased in real terms and some reforms aimed at  attracting private investments in infrastructure were made. But in late 2021 Bolsonaro gave up on the neoliberal agenda and fully embraced fiscal populism, effectively ending Temer's spending cap.

Bolsonaro's dream would be to copy Mussolini and ""march on Brasilia"", but that wasn't possible, so he decided to follow the 'new authoritarian' handbook and slowly erode Brazilian democracy. Naturally, the first step would be to neutralize the Supreme Court. During his electoral compaign, he announced that he would pack our Court with ten new ministers. Since 2019, thus, he's been calling for rallies against Supreme Court ministers and denoucing an alleged ""dictatorship of the judiciary"" in Brazil.

But the pandemic got in the way of his coup-plotting adventures. Speaking of which, Bolsonaro's handling of the pandemic was disastrous. He was explicitly pro-virus. He delayed the purchase of vaccines while he encouraged the usage of hydroxychloroquine. In October 2020, he said that ""the vaccines won't be bought \[...\] the Brazilian people will not be anyone's guinea pig"" and in December he discouraged the usage of vaccines, hinting that you could turn into an alligator if you took it: ""If you take it and turn into an alligator, that's your problem"". Studies estimate that at least one hundred thousand Brazilians died because of his delay in buying the vaccine.

In 2021 his coup-planning returned in full force. In March, the three commanders of the Armed Forces, in an unprecedented act in our history, resigned together, against an apparent call by Bolsonaro for a self-coup.

But the biggest coup attempt was on the commemoration of 199 years of Brazil's independence, on September 7, 2021. With millions on the streets, Bolsonaro took advantage of the holiday to demonstrate his popular support while attempting to mobilize riots in state military forces. He also declared that he would no longer obey orders from the Supreme Court. The political class suggested that it would initiate impeachment proceedings and Bolsonaro backed down, making him a very fragile president.

Therefore, after his coup attempt in 2021, Bolsonaro could be impeached at any moment. As a consequence, he had to give everything he had to the Atraso. Most of his ministries were given to corrupt politicians of the Centrão and the ""Secret Budget"", a massive corruption scandal in which tens of billions of reais were allocated by MPs without any transparency, was created.

The Bolsonaro administration was simply terrible in many other areas (such as, for example, environmental policy), but that's not the topic of this post, so I'll jump straight to the 2022 elections.

After failing to found his own political party in 2019, Bolsonaro was forced to join a party of the Atraso to run for the 2022 election. He chose the Liberal Party (PL). At the start of 2022, Bolsonaro was very unpopular due to high inflation. Thus, he decided to abuse his newly gained parliamentary majority to throw away all of our fiscal rules and spend his way into reelection. He increased many social benefits and cut fuel taxes to zero, spending tens of billions of dollars.

""In almost 50 years of public life, I have never seen a use and abuse of the public machine like the one that occurred in this last election. What could and couldn't be done was done to win the election. \[...\] We are grateful to the Brazilian people, who gave us a lesson in democracy, and grateful to president Lula. Only he could win this election."" said Geraldo Alckmin in an interview in 2023.

Alckmin was the governor of Brazil's most important state, São Paulo, for four terms. He ran for president twice, losing to Lula in the second round in 2006. A centre-right politician, many people thought his political carreer was over after he finished fourth in the 2018 presidential election. They were wrong: in 2021, Fernando Haddad, the Workers' Party candidate in 2018, articulated for Alckmin to become Lula's running mate. He accepted the offer.

In 2022, Alckmin joined the Brazilian Socialist Party (PSB) and became Lula's running mate. Their alliance symbolized a broad front against Bolsonaro. All of the major candidates of the 2018 presidential election (besides Bolsonaro, of course) supported Lula in the second round, even the libertarian candidate.

In the end, Lula won the tightest election in Brazilian history with 50.9% of the vote.

**VI. Lula III**

The third Lula administration began even before Lula became president. To change the budget set by Bolsonaro for 2023, which reduced various social expenditures, Lula had to pass a Constitutional Amendment (the ""Transition Amendment"") in December 2022. In that same month, he announced his economic team. Fernando Haddad was nominated for the Finance Ministry, and Simone Tebet, a social-liberal candidate who came third in the elections, was appointed to the Ministry of Planning.

Despite calling himself a libertarian socialist, Haddad is one of the most moderate members of the Workers' Party. In recent weeks, he has come to be seen as the moderate/liberal wing of the government and has gained the support of sectors of the financial market.

Brazil's fiscal situation is very precarious, and Haddad's plan to improve it is made up of four key components: (1) reinstating taxes that were cut by Bolsonaro during the election period, (2) establishing a new fiscal framework that anchors fiscal expectations (to be presented to Congress this month), (3) undertaking a spending review of existing programs to lower spending while increasing social impact, and (4) cutting government subsidies (Brazil has a serious problem of ""income redistribution"" to the richest).

Besides adressing the fiscal issue, Haddad also suggests three other general lines of economic policy that will be followed. The first is to pass a Tax Reform, which would simplify Brazilian taxes. The second refers to the resumption of international agreements, with emphasis on the treaty between the European Union and Mercosur. And the third is a major investments plan in partnership with the private sector, probably led by Chief of Staff Rui Costa.

One area of major concern for the government today is the credit sector. A billion-dollar fraud by the Brazilian retail chain Lojas Americanas has just been uncovered, with systemic effects on credit channels and sources of financing. In this context, the Lula administration has been pressuring the Central Bank to lower interest rates, which are currently the highest in the world in real values.  Without an adequate response, a collapse of the credit market could lead to a recession. 

Two other areas where we'll probably see major advances are education and the environment. For the former, the educational experience of Ceará, which is a clear highlight in Brazil, must be transposed nationally by Education Minister Camilo Santana, who was governor of the state between 2014 and 2022. For the environment, Marina Silva is back as Environment Minister and should give prominence to the climate issue again.

Lula has reinstated the Family Allowance welfare program and increased its benefits. He has also considerably increased the minimum wage and the income tax exemption bracket. He also plans to pass a reform that increases taxes on the wealthiest in the second half of the year.

But all these plans could be frustrated if Lula does not form a large enough coalition in Congress. As of early March, we still don't know whether or not Lula will have a congressional majority. The current president of the Chamber of Deputies, Arthur Lira, is a member of the Centrão and a supporter of Bolsonaro. He was reelected in February with the votes of both the Workers' Party and the Liberal Party. A couple of days ago, he said that Lula's congressional base was unstable: ""We are waiting for the government's base to mature. \[...\] We will have some time, also, for the government to stabilize internally \[...\] Today, the government still does not have a consistent base in the House and Senate for matters of simple majority, let alone matters of constitutional quorum"".

Lula will probably reorganize his ministries at some point this year, giving more space to the parties of the Atraso in order to 'stabilize internally' and 'mature the government's base'. In the Senate the situation is probably a bit more confortable. Rodrigo Pacheco, Lula's candidate and part of a 'light' Centrão, was reelected with 49 votes, enough to pass Constitutional Amendments.

Now, about the invasion of the three powers on January 8. As far as we know, the invasion had been planned since the beginning of the month by right-wing radicals and only went well because it had the support of the Federal District government. The governor has already been ousted and the Justice Secretary arrested. More than a thousand people have been arrested by the police. 

Operation Lesa Patria is investigating the coup attempt and has already arrested several  Bolsonaristas across the country. Figuring out who were the financiers of the attack is a bit difficult, but it shouldn't be too hard to prove that the planner was Jair Bolsonaro.

Bolsonarist Senator Marcos do Val revelead a couple of weeks ago that he had been invited by Bolsonaro to stage a coup d'état. The plan looked like something out of a children's cartoon: they wanted to induce a Supreme Court Justice to say that he had violated the Constitution, using a wiretap to record the conversation. The Federal Police also found in the house of Bolsonaro's former Justice Minister a draft decree that would revert the result of the election.

Lastly, it remains to talk about the government's foreign policy. Lula's plan seems to be to return Brazil to its traditional role: a ""reasonably important, but rarely decisive, voice of a secondary power, with some influence in the Global South and in multilateral forums"". He is currently trying to reach a peace treaty for the Ukraine War, but I doubt he will achieve any effective results.

Brazil is in a complicated situation. Lula will have to rebuild Brazilian democracy and develop a new economic model to resume economic growth at the same time. It won't be easy, but Lula is the great politician of his generation and I am hopeful that he can deliver good results. 

And a final remark: one positive thing that should occur in the coming years is the unification of political parties due to the new electoral law introduced in 2017. We will probably only have around eight political forces in 2026! We still don't know, however, which of them is going to lead the brazilian right, who will have to recompose itself after bolsonarism.",50,43,1678413766.0
11kwmac,SocialDemocracy,Finland 2023 election thread,SalusPublica,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/11kwmac/finland_2023_election_thread/,"With under a month to go until the Finnish parliamentary elections it’s time to make an election thread. For a simple guide to the Finnish parliamentary elections, I recommend reading this [informative guide](https://yle.fi/a/74-20020980) made by the public service provider YLE.  I will try to provide a more in-depth guide below, with some useful links in case you want to learn more about the Finnish elections.

# Background

Sanna Marin/Rinne’s government has been governing for almost four years now and it has been a rough period to govern, with COVID-19 crippling the global economy and an energy crisis caused by Russia’s war on Ukraine. SDP has still managed to keep their promises and achieve the goals that we set up in the government programme in 2019, most notably Marin’s government managed to reach the goal of an employment rate of 75%. A goal that critics saw as unreachable. SDP is now aiming for another term with Sanna Marin as prime minister, with the goal to achieve a 2% GDP growth every year by raising the employment rate to 80%, raising the education rate and investing 4% of GDP annually on research and innovation.

SDPs election programme is available [in English](https://www.sdp.fi/en/parliamentary-election-2023/election-programme/) in case you are interested in learning more about SDPs goals for the upcoming elections.

**Voting**

Election day is 2 April and advance voting from 22 to 28 March.

Voting abroad from 22 to to 25 March

For official information regarding voting, visit [vaalit.fi/en/](https://vaalit.fi/en/)

&#x200B;

**The election system**

The standard electoral period is four years an there are 200 seats in the Finnish Parliament. The seats are proportionally divided between [13 electoral districts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constituencies_of_Finland), Helsinki being the largest with 22 mandates and Lapland the smallest mainland district with 7 mandates. The self-governing Åland islands also holds a single mandate quota.

The representatives are voted directly based on proportional representation (The D’hondt method).

&#x200B;

**The Parliament and it's traditions**

The Finnish legislative power is divided into two chambers: in general, government initiates legislation and the Parliament passes legislation.

Traditionally, the party with the most votes get assigned the task to form a government coalition. Majority coalitions are favoured, therefore broad coalitions spanning over the left-right political spectrum are quite common. Traditionally, the parties won’t form coalitions prior to the elections.

&#x200B;

**Polling**

The [latest polls](https://yle.fi/a/3-12562011) show that it’s going to be a tight race between the three biggest parties with NCP in the lead, SDP closing in and the Finns’ party in third place.

Edit 30.3. The positions have changed. NCP is still losing support but so is SDP. The Finns party have now passed SDP and are in second place with SDP in third place. But all the changes fit withing the margin of error so the positions might still change on election day.

# Political climate

A recent poll from the Finnish news outlet MTV showed that these are the main topics Finnish voters are currently interested in:

|Healthcare and social services|48 %|
|:-|:-|
|Food prices|31 %|
|Foreign- and security policy|30 %|
|Taxation|29 %|
|Education|28 %|
|Economy|26 %|
|National debt:|24 %|
|Eldercare|24 %|
|National security|24 %|
|Marginalization and poverty|23 %|
|Employment|21 %|
|Children and early-education|21 %|
|Electricity prices|20 %|

&#x200B;

**National debt**

The main conversation topic for this election period has become the national debt rate. In the last quarter of 2022, the debt rate was 51,6%, slightly under the general EU debt rate. This is becoming an issue because of a rapidly ageing population. In 2020, Finland ranked among the five fastest ageing populations worldwide. Because of the proportionally high rates of elders needing public healthcare and social services in relation to working taxpayers, Finland has been in a budget deficit for quite some time and right-wing politicians are calling for major cuts in government spending to tackle the growing debt rates.

*Disclaimer: This is nothing new. As long as I’ve lived, the same fearmongering over the debt rate has been brought up every election year.*

&#x200B;

**Sanna Marin or Petteri Orpo as PM?**

Sanna Marin is the most popular Finnish PM this century. A recent poll showed that 68% are happy with her government, and poll results from December 2022 show that 26% would want for Sanna Marin to continue as PM and 21% instead favour the main opposition leader Petteri Orpo (NCP). Although being popular, Marin sparks a lot of controversy because of her being a young and quite unconventional PM. Many oppose her for not following traditions when it comes to how a PM should look and behave and a lot of it stems from sexism, which can be confirmed by the fact that significantly more women than men see Marin as fit to lead the country.

Although Sanna Marin is widely popular, SDP is facing a issue where Marin is more popular than the party itself.

*Edit: According to a opinion poll* [published March 7th](https://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/politics/23088-national-coalition-and-finns-party-forming-a-government-preferred-by-23-of-finns.html)*, 24 % want a the next prime minister to be from NCP, 23 % want a PM from SDP. This shows how fierce the competition for the prime minister's post is.*

&#x200B;

**Finns party vs the liberals**

The national conservative Finns party is widely unpopular among socially liberal voters and three months prior to the elections, SDP, the Left Alliance and the Greens ruled out government coalition with the Finns. When asked about SDP:s stance, Marin said that SDP won’t compromise with a racist party like the Finns. This sparked some controversy, firstly because it’s not common for Finnish parties to rule out government cooperation prior to the elections. Secondly because it’s not common to outspokenly claim a party to be racist in the way that Marin did. Critics are saying that Marin and the other party leaders are causing polarisation and pushing for block politics, which is generally frowned upon in the Finnish political culture.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

With the election being a tight race between the right-wing parties calling for major cuts in public spending, dismantling the welfare state that social democrats and the worker’s movement have been building for a hundred years, I’m calling for all of you to make sure that your Finnish friends, living in Finland or abroad, won’t waste their opportunity to vote in the upcoming elections.

w0lcx0,SocialDemocracy,A Critique of Capitalism and our approach to it,DependentCarpet,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/w0lcx0/a_critique_of_capitalism_and_our_approach_to_it/,"Fellow comrades and friends,

I know that I will once again ruffle some feathers with this ... and I simply don't care. While a lot in this sub debate how we should define several words and meanings, I would argue that we loose focus and track on the real problems of the current time.

While inflation and economic stagnation rock us all (some more than others sadly), I would like to argue that we have to change a few things around here to even make a future possible and viable. And the biggest point of this might be, is that we have to look how we deal and interact with capitalism as SocDems and especially in the parties in which we do our part. Doing this, the following text will look at the historic and current perspective with the end arguing why a reform of capitalism to democratic socialism is necessary for a sound future. In this I will probably dismantle some views and/or diasgreeing a lot. It is on you to read it, but I'd like that you still read it - especially if you disagree with the words before you.

   
 

**Historical anaylsis**

As we all know, Social Democracy stems from the rise of socialist movements in the late 19th century. The original goal (which in theory still exists up until today) is to achieve Socialism via democratic means - ergo Democratic Socialism. With the aftermaths of World War I, a lot of SocDem parties got into power. Especially in Austria, for a time between 1918 and 1920, the ruling SDAP in cooperation with the conservative CS, achieved a system which for its time was quite forward-thinking. Only the Soviet Union had (in theory) better workers protections, healthcare etc. But in comparison to the USSR, in Austria it was achieved and lived in a fully democratic society.

Most parties pursued still the notion of Democratic Socialism, as they clearly saw the deficits of Capitalism. Achieving the 8 hour work day was only the small start of what we would have to accomplish in the decades to come. Of course, one can't overturn capitalism over night - and the term revolution was more adopted towards a reformist meaning. The SPD for instance had this problem and/or debate in the interwar-period. 

On the other hand, the SFIO in France and SDAP in Austria saw clearly, that Capitalism can't continue forever, especially that said countries had to deal with setbacks due to economic-friendly and/or conservative governments. Otto Bauer put forward a critique of the system that not only reduces itself to the simple view. Rationalising in Capitalism must fail to a huge degree, as said rationalisation would mostly hit the workers - those that did the work. Maximising profit too would hurt as well as the lack of workers say in companies and production. 

With World War II and its aftermaths, Social Democracy had an odd turn. On the one hand most of them saw how several liberal groups joined the radical right, which promised to protect their rights - most of all the monopolists and great company owners. On the other hand they saw that a reform towards Socialism on a faster track could again throw back the movement. 

 

With several reforms inside the structures like the Godesberger Programm and other similar ideas in Europe, Social Democratic parties arranged themselves with the existance of Capitalism. Therefore, while they still uttered critique, they mainly focused on making Capitalism humane - with workers rights, higher and progressive taxes etc. Still, only Germany, Austria and Sweden really continued the idea of Democratic Socialism up until the 1970s to some degree. With the NeoLib wave of the late 1970s this changed - Social Democratic parties in droves accepted Capitalism as ""the only way"", more so after the collapse of the Eastern Bloc. Blair and Schröder lead this thought to even more unkonwn heights, as they made friends with radical Capitalists with the belief that the economy is the solution to all problems.

As we all know, this failed.

 

**Enter Keynes**

With climate change, the war in Ukraine and the first aftermaths of the Covid years, we have several problems at hand. We had to see with our own eyes that the globalised system of *laissez-faire* Capitalism steered into doom for millions of people. Now, most shout for more state intervention - in short for classic Keynesian methods as in the 1930s and 1940s in the US or changed versions in Europe up until the 1970s.

Keynes in short stipulated that the state needs to act counter-circular to the highs and lows of the economy. One way is to implement hug spending programs in times of economic downturn (like the New Deal in the US or Austrokeynesianism in 1970s Austria). The goal should be to reduce unemployment to a low number and strengthen the welfare state. How and when this should end he never stated - therefore his students and others misinterpreted his words into sometimes downright perverse logics, some reading neoclassic and neoliberal things into it.

While Keynes never really went on a direct set of plans, his ideas saved in the eyes of a lot of economists and historians Capitalism in the 1930s. One could too argue that Keynes form of economic liberalism was a cooperation of state and free market. And I would argue that, although he never saw that to be the case, Keynes might have laid one step for a reform of Capitalism into Socialism without ever mentioning it. 

One example of this was the second phase of Austrosocialism, also in part known as Austrokeynesianism in the late 1960s and 1970s. The SPÖ under Bruno Kreisky wanted to use the potential of Keynes ideas in real life and he had an interesting test bed for it - the public industries. After World War II, several branches of the economy, like the steel industry, were nationalised and therefore under direct goverment control. To lower unemployment, Kreisky and his one-party government pumped money into the expansion of both the nationalised industry as well as the critical infrastructure. At the same time, while inflation was hiking due to the OPEC crises, they managed to give essential goods to lowered prices to the people. Adding to that, The 1970s would be known as the Austrian Golden Age. The thing that took it all down was the neoliberal revolution of the late 1970s. Kreiskys successors Sinowatz and Vranitzky changed their course - even before the tax rates for high incomes were good but improveable while (for good reasons) lowering them for the masses.

&#x200B;

**Current problems and solutions**

With all crises at hand now, we have to look for other solutions. Continuing the current form of Capitalism with added welfare programs (that in part don't really work) won't solve any problem. Neither climate nor inflation nor social problems.

Inflation in several EU countries hiked close to 9% lately, gas prices have seen rises of up to 40+% rises in a short time and the implementation of more renewables is lacking due to several factors. Adding to that are the waves of problems related with Covid - financial downfall and social structures crumbling. Several European countries (mostly those with conservative or more economic-liberal governments) saw huge falls in their outlooks. And their solutions are either non-existant, batshit crazy or totally useless. An example of this: the current Austrian government wants to use the technique of a water can - to give everyone 500€ as a climate bonus. This bonus is paid out only this year and it won't change anything at all. Even tax deductions haven't brought any help while they stubbornly refuse to rise taxes on high-earning and rich people by a single tenth of a percent. Adding to that is the lack of war profit taxes for several industries. Especially electricity companies this year calculate huge profit margins that exceed those of former years by up to 200% or more. Still, no one in government wants to tax that for no reason.

&#x200B;

In short: the rich want unfettered Capitalism to continue, even and especially the United States in its frenzy for ""liberalism"" which would lately rather classify as a degressive system for the masses. And ""Welfare Capitalists"" only want to make the system ""humane"" rather than really reform it.

Let me tell you something: if you really believe that Capitalism like this can continue, I will have to shatter that illusion to you. Even for those self-ascribed ""Welfare Capitalists"" that remain stubborn at all costs. I might recommend to get of your high horse for a few hours and look at how life really is outside your warm and comfy room.

&#x200B;

**The necessity of Democratic Socialism and how to reach it**

While most will think that I might be crazy: yeah, I am. For the simple reason that I am confronted with the misery of modern Capitalism and non-working/partially defunct welfare systems due to bathsit government. Having friends that are poor, working as an assistant worker besides finishing my studies and being the child of labourers. Had to learn most things myself, that is how I found to Democratic Socialism. 

To clarify the next: no I don't want a violent revolution, rather a reform with a revolutionary spirit guiding. In short: reform but with active goals and means, inspired by Olof Palme. I see the rising prices of almost everything, that parents can't afford essential things anymore without needing a loan. That students and pupils lack essential parts of their school kit for classes. How more and more people loose their own welfare and slide into poverty ... every single day. I assume most of you weren't jobless in their life once - I was, and it was horrible. You couldn't think clearly for a certain time, I couldn't even continue my things for University. Everything was hard - I started to drink Alcohol daily, so much so that I spent more on it in one month than the last four combined. I started to smoke cigarettes again.

Somehow, I scratched the curve and came back - sobered up and very close on finishing my BA thesis while again working currently. 

&#x200B;

Democratic Socialism relies on democratic means to reasc Socialism, therefore is a reformist way, a bit faster than what is percieved as ""Modern"" Social Democracy. A critique of Capitalism is necessary for two essential reasons: to act as the counterpart of those that blindly believe in it and to dismantle it once the chance arises. Some things like extension of welfare and higher tax rates for certain groups in society are first parts. The nationalisation of essential infrastructure (like roads, rails, electricity etc.) would be the second huge one - and a very necessary one. A thrid to look at the wrongdoings of Capitalism and dealing with them: labour laws, healthcare, free education (school and especially outside school), income raises and active work/participation of trade unions.

Trade unions would be an essential tool, as democratic say in company matters needs to be improved, even in Austria. One idea is to give all workers a certain ammount of stocks, so they have a greater say in the company and that they would get a dividend from it. Over time, this would in my view lead to more democratic means in companies like voting on executive positions and other things. For some time, I would argue for a mixed economic system with more participation. Another idea is to reform both Keynes ideas and the Rehn-Meidner Plan for a transition to Democratic Socialism.

And yes. preserving an open society as well as certain private property rights needs to exist, there is no doubt about that. But the massive accumulation of certain people is both a hinderance and a mistake in the system. Capping the maximum ammount would be one idea, everything above it would be taxed with 100%.

Last but not least, we have to look at the Climate. My idea of Democratic Socialism would include the unconditional nationalisation of electrical providers. To fund the turn to alternative energy, we would use both private incentives and state means to reach this. All patents and developments would remain solely in state hands with dividends and/or certain contracts for private companies. With this, we would more easily and faster transition towards an eco-friendly society in a shorter ammount of years. Adding to it would be the idea, that those with higher carbon footprints would either have to pay way higher fees or directly invest into such programmes while reducing their footprints. Preaching reducing carbon emissions to poorer people is useless as they (per capita) cause way less carbon emissions than righ people. Investments into rail and/or emission reduced/free flight is another idea.

**Final remarks**

I can't promise any beautiful landscapes for the future nor am I a wizard. I know that the way forward is hard and some might not really understand it or even defame me for it. I can live with that in all honesty. I will discuss the topic with almsot anyone, except those that won't argue in good faith. While it isn't easy, I will respect the opinion of others as I expect and assume that the same happens with my views. 

It seems petty to me to squabble over so many small things when we don't continue the way forward, especially in these trying times. We all have to learn to embrace the necessity of change, but too to watch out for an open and active society. Democracy needs an open society, disagreement and debate - but too action and change.

&#x200B;

I would therefore like to argue, that the way of Democratic Socialism for me isn't necessarily radical or a danger, but if done right a good way into the future for us all. Social Democracy and Democratic Socialism for me are not only interchangeable terms, but linked. They both have the same end goal - even if some disagree. Welfare Capitalism, as some might call the new goal of Social Democracy, can be a waystop - but in my view never be the end goal.

Still, we will see what the future will bring. And to those that read this and whose blood is pumping: I don't want to take away all your things nor deport you to a labour camp. I just want that we all, according to our possibilites and abilities, give to society so everyone can and will live a better life.

**We have some things to loose, but a whole world and better future to win!**

y4p3mu,SocialDemocracy,Revolutionary vision and reformist detail work,DependentCarpet,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/y4p3mu/revolutionary_vision_and_reformist_detail_work/,"As we are in the year 2022, we have seen more than thirty years of Social Democracy drifting away from its own ideology and vision. Blinded by the words of Francis Fukuyama, that the final victory of „liberal democracy“ over Socialism (that had a lot of flaws), must mean the „end of history“ as well as the end of all ideologies alltogether.

Now, in our times we can see quite clearly that these words were a lie, that the belief they associated were blinding lights at the end of the day.

As flawed as the socialist system of the Warsaw Pact and associated states was, it at least constructed a form of counter balance towards the liberal democracies - the latter weren‘t really defined and are still in some way work in progress. It forced the western nations to implement more social policies to avoid conflicts that destroyed the world order following the First World War.

Most Social Democratic parties caught up on this neoliberal bandwagon, which proved to be the most futile attempt to regain power. Instead of criticising the system of Thatcher, Reagan and Kohl, bringing up new and real ideas on the way towards Democratic Socialism, leaders like Blair, Schröder, Klima and others sought to associate themselves with the new ideas of Neoliberalism.

While some thought and still think this was a good idea, their daemonic shadows haunt Social Democracy to this day. We sure have failed to both live up to our own visions as well as to reform the parties in such trying times - rather to work hard for new ideas a lot of us sought to arrange themselves with the new times. It would and still proves deadly to this day.

**Understanding the world in front of us**

A lot has changed since the successes of the 1970s. Portugal and Spain are now established democracies, social policies have a strong impact on our lives, most things improved. But did they? Looking at the slaughter since the 1980s in some nations, I do believe that Social Democratic parties like Labour committed mistakes to keep themselves in power. For instance the (misinterpreted) words of Willy Brandt in 1969 „We want a society that offers more freedom and demands more share of responsibility.“ Brandt probably didn‘t mean the interpretation of „freedom“ associated with NeoLib policies in which freedom is only for the individual alone - that you as an individual can only help yourself. It is inherently flawed as in my view it shows the dark beliefs of Social Darwinism, that society has no worth anymore. 

Freedom sure has a ton of definitions, but the one most striking for me (and the one that makes most sense in terms of Social Democracy) would be the following: as much personal freedom as possible for all without intruding into the freedoms of others. Freedom can not be limitless as it would kill freedom as such outright.

Ironically, Karl Popper (called as one of the greatest liberals of the 20th century) can be read as a Social Democrat/Socialist in a lot of ways. The definition I brought up before mostly draws from his book „The Open Society and its Enemies“. He had his problem with Marxism and it‘s historicist outlook. Allright, I might conccur with that - Marxism surely has its flaws, no one can deny that. 

But it would be cheap and almost foolish to draw ourselves away from the good points Marx brought forth. He never established a real system of how a (fully) Socialist economy could and would work - Lenin did. Marx never outright mentioned how the transition should work - either by violence or reform. Marx biggest flaw was his vagueness, his writing stlye that allowed a ton of interpretations (similar to the Bible). 

But his greatest achievement was to put a vision before that was taken up by so many prominent people since. Everyone drew from it, no matter the state, heritage or gender. That unfettered capitalism can‘t work, that it destroys the fabric of both state and society and would lead to its own deprivation of humanity.

Even Popper said that restricting some freedoms so everyone benefits from it may be necessary. That democracy needs institutions and therefore people/society to work. That an economy needs to be regulated to a certain degree and some parts may need to be put into public hands.

That all isn‘t new - we just lost it. Neoliberalism destroyed the basic foundations of political Liberalism as we know it for the failed belief in „the freer the market, the freer the people“. It launched part of the world back into the times of Marx and Engels, where no regulations existed, children had to work from the age of seven years old. 

That we blinded ourselves to the belief we were all free, but never heard our own shackles until it was too late.

**The question of vision**

Yesterday I was part of the Educational Conference of the SPÖ Upper Austria. There, the heard of the education department held a short presentation of what outlooks we as a SocDem party might have/need to have. He brought forth a simple set of quotes by Bruno Kreisky. One in a letter to Brandt and Palme in 1973 where he mentioned the necessity to change society for the bette as part of the vision of Social Democracy. The other from a speech at the Party Conference in 1978, where probably the most progressive and visionary Party Programme was put to debate. There he said that the questions of the future are there, we just need answers for them - we should be guided by the ideals that we have and look for answers in every place possible. 

To never forget the grand mission of Social Democracy: fighting for a better world, to offer the people of the nations as well as the world a future, where Equality, Freedom, Justice, Solidarity and Democracy are no mere phrases uttered from time to time. Instead them being our daily lived by guiding principles - that there is no suffering, no war, no exploitation.

Sure, reforms are necessary for a myriade of reasons, most are obvious as times change. But the question we need to ask ourselves at first is a very delicate one: can we combine Pragmatism and Ideology? I would answer yes - some would say no. They‘d view Pragmatism, the focus on small daily politics, as the necessity of the 21st century. Most lost the look for the bigger picture, the view on visions and guidelines - that we need to promise a better future that people would believe. We lost that sadly doe to a ton of mistakes, but I am sure and confident that we could bring this back with the younger generations of this society.

Climate Crisis, poverty, inflation, changing industries, the rich bourgeoisie - these are all valid fears. And only with a certain strong belief in ourselves and the mission we carry forth like toches into a dark night we might succeed to overcome them.

**Leftism - more than necessary!**

As mentioned above, the presentation had two quotes of Kreisky included. As he presented them (him being quite the leftie), the head of education said „Today such things and sentences would be considered radical leftism in the SPÖ“.

Which prompted me to say in a short speech to one of the proposals later „Thanks for the reminder on Kreisky, his ideas of vision and how we need to change society for good. You said that these things would be unheard in our party today. Therefore I put myself in solidarity with Kreisky, I am outing myself as a radical leftie“. Some laughter and applause followed. 

I am not ashamed of calling myself a radical leftie in such a regard. I see the necessity to go beyond daily politics and petty prgamatism to view the necessities of tomorrow as good as I can. That is one huge reason why I consider myself as a Democratic Socialist - because Social Democracy lived as it should be was, is and must always be Democratic Socialism. You may disagree wtih it and please do - I don‘t claim to speak the truth nor do any of you. 

Leftism is no bad thing, quite the contrary. „Revolutionäre Kleinarbeit“ (Revolutionary Detail Work) was a short article from a speech that Otto Bauer held in the early 1930s in front of Sociaist Youth members. There he mentioned that Alexander the Great, Caesar and Napoleon may have been great men, but they required and needed the work of millions for them to succeed. Today, the names of the great men remained alive while the millions go unmentioned. 

Bauer says in a bit more complicated words the following: sure we might have great party leaders, but we need you all for our mission to succeed. He didn‘t mention a strong belief in leftist views and visions, but he would imply them. But to look at them critically, not believing it all 100%, to understand them rather than accept them outright. I concurr with Bauer there - he has a valid point.

Leftism now is needed more than ever, after almost 40 years of Social emocratic parties sacrificing themselves to ideas the didn‘t work or did more harm than good - how the anti-democratic right once again rose to power in several states with severe consequences. As an Austrian I saw/still see it first hand. We suffer 10% inflation, work providers don‘t want huge wage increases and several economists fear that higher wages could increase inflation. The working class and middle class loose a lot of their money on it all while a few rich people rnrich themselves even more. 

Now would be a time for us to once again demand high-earner taxes, windfall taxes, to increase the intervention in the markets. In short: to provide a good life for all people, not the few!

**Conclusion and final remarks**

You may think what you want on this topic, some of you might call me crazy - but if that is crazy to you, please look outside of your screen what is happening today. The world won‘t change when you sit in front of your screen all day, it won‘t change by debating every single letter in a defintion, it won‘t change by your amateurish political takes on stuff.

Learn to understand the world outside the internet.

Olof Palme was born rich and lived a life where he could stand beside a factory worker and say „You are my friend, we are equals“, same goes for Kreisky. Brandt was born poor, as was Vranitzky and other Social Democratic leaders. It is easy to speak of leftist values, but to live by them, fight for them with every breath you take is another thing entirely.

With this in mind, I would like to appeal to those that find a purpose in the fight for a better world besides the daily prgamatism, to look for new answers in these trying times.

To not be afraid of the leftist label, to stop the degeneration of Social Democratic ideology for the short success of an „Catch-all-party“. A programme that promises a better future combined with reasoned pragmatism will catch more people than you might think. Revolution being our ambitious visions, reformism the pragmatic style of how we want to reach it!

With this I say: long live the fight for a better and fair world - to one day reach Democratic Socialism!

Long live a visionary and progressive Social Democracy!

vbhjd4,SocialDemocracy,Thoughts on Singapore?,DefendThePie,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/vbhjd4/thoughts_on_singapore/,"Hi there. 

Despite being pretty obscure and insignificant on the world stage, I feel like Singapore (where I'm from) has a fairly interesting mix of left-right policies and political climate.

**Warning: Long read ahead, skip to the end if you know enough about Singapore**

Our ruling party since independence, the People's Action Party (PAP) started as a socialist party in opposition. As soon as they got into power, the larger centrist wing of the party kicked out the quasi-communist wing, and immediately started establishing the undemocratic systems present today, and also prosecuted/disappeared all their dissidents.

The PAP undoubtedly allowed Singapore to progress massively post-independence, but started turning extremely conservative and more right-wing since the neoliberal boom in the 1980s.

**Democracy** in Singapore is extremely limited. Article 14(II) of the constitution allows parliament to infringe on the rights to free speech, assembly, press etc of citizens, so the PAP obviously started exploiting it since independence to benefit themselves. 

Our general elections are free, but extremely unfair. Seats are allocated in multi-member constituencies by FPTP, which not only disadvantages smaller parties, that cannot field enough candidates to contest in many constituencies, but also allows the PAP to field a team of candidates consisting of a high-ranking minister and a few other unknowns, causing citizens to notice the one minister and vote for the entire group as a whole. (The PAP's justification for this system is that it requires at least one candidate to be from a minority group, which is total bs as the winners are whoever the PAP wants them to be). The PAP also has the sole right to gerrymander all these constituencies before every election. Campaigning is also only allowed right before elections, and is extremely short. As such, Singaporeans have been exposed to opposition parties for a tiny fraction of their lives.

Freedoms of speech are restricted in Singapore with laws like POFMA, which allows the PAP to restrict access to any information, post etc online, which it has obviously done to its political advantage. Its members (and notably the prime minister) also can sue anyone that publicly criticises the party/government.

Freedom of assembly is nonexistent in Singapore, with small and even satirical protests/demonstrators being arrested by the police (this is in the name of national peace and security), which is more attractive to corporations looking to set up in peaceful nations.

The government owns nearly all press and local news, appoints their editors, and can revoke the licenses of any press agency if they put out any content too critical of the government. (Western news outlets have regularly been targeted before) As such, nearly all major news outlets are basically PAP loudspeakers.

**Healthcare/Housing/Utilities** and other related topics of contention are actually very good in Singapore, with everything being either publicly owned or being state-sanctioned competition/monopolies and being highly regulated. The healthcare system is efficient and affordable enough, mainly done through subsidies, but could certainly improve up to the standards of Nordic countries. We have a brilliant public housing system that over 80% of the population lives in, that are high quality, comfortable, and extremely land-efficient. The government owns all land, and implements a very successful Georgist land value tax of upt o 17% of the land's value. Singapore also has pretty great public transport and city planning. However, the PAP implemented these policies mostly out of necessity, rather than actually wanting to implement leftist policies.

**Education** and the curriculum is completely determined by the government under the ministry of education. Topics like LGBTQ are either banned or highly restricted, and ""social studies"" lessons are more like indoctrination sessions, mainly used to explain to students the reasoning behind PAP policies (anti-democracy, low taxes, etc). However, it is also undeniable that it has produced intelligent and capable but subservient students, ready to be fed into the employment system. 

**Taxes** are extremely low in Singapore, especially for the rich and corporations. Singapore is a well known Asian tax haven. This is supposedly to increase Singaporean competitiveness and attractiveness to foreign investment and wealthy people to boost the economy.

**Spending and welfare** is very limited in Singapore. The PAP is very fiscally conservative, and constantly ran a budget surplus before covid. Though this means it has large reserves and doesn't have to bicker with debt issues like in other nations, it also has to keep a very low amount of spending. Singapore has next to no welfare, with citizens expected to work to provide for themselves, and the government occasionally chipping in when things get very dire. However, the government is still very interventionist, to the point where it micromanages a lot of stuff.

**Social issues** are highly conservative in Singapore. The PAP kept behind colonial-era laws like 377A, which criminalises sex between male adults, and has not implemented laws to recognise same-sex marriage and other LGBT-related issues. Usage of drugs is highly illegal. However, Singapore has a very pro-choice abortion policy, which I suspect is because the PAP likes nuclear families and doesn't want a bunch of single mothers relying on welfare to make ends meet.

**Support for the government** is obviously difficult to measure. The PAP does not allow political polling of any kind, and never does referendums. It generally gets 60%-70% of the vote in general elections, but ironically, when it's supporters bring this up, it can be very easily argued that due to the PAP's efforts to restrict democracy, this figure is not a real representation of the PAP 's support among the population.

**Skip here**

All this was written by a relatively young SocDem, extremely critical of the current government and system. I'm considered one of the crazy political people that keep ranting about the government and argue with teachers during social studies, but nevertheless, I feel like the younger generation here is quite progressive. I've only met one homophobic person around my age in my entire life, and young people in general were much more willing to recognise the mistakes of and criticise the government. Alas, the PAP, having total power, has to voluntarily implement change for things to get better. 

What are your thoughts on the PAP, it's policies or the political climate in general?

Where do we go from here?,HealthMotor8651,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialDemocracy/comments/uiozkq/it_seems_the_right_has_basically_won_where_do_we/,"This is a post about right wing politics more broadly, and goes beyond just Roe and the like, but it was inspired by recent decisions.

\-----------------------------------

The way I see it, this country is basically fucked. Roe is just the start. Because of obstructionists in Congress, Obama was unable to add even the most centrist of judges. This left a LOT of vacant spaces throughout the judicial system, including the supreme court. Who filled them? None other than Trump, and they fast tracked that shit: [https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/17/trump-judges-nominees-court-picks-243834](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/17/trump-judges-nominees-court-picks-243834) (these talk about nominees, but plenty passed and ""serve"" today). Why is this a problem? Cause it will likely see rollbacks of various guarantees of rights and protections for vulnerable groups, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/22/braun-supreme-court-interracial-marriage/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/22/braun-supreme-court-interracial-marriage/), [https://www.reuters.com/world/us/gay-marriage-other-rights-risk-after-us-supreme-court-abortion-move-2022-05-04/](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/gay-marriage-other-rights-risk-after-us-supreme-court-abortion-move-2022-05-04/), [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/jim-obergefell-gay-marriage-roe-v-wade-b2070905.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/jim-obergefell-gay-marriage-roe-v-wade-b2070905.html).

The courts are now largely right wing. Due to the structure of Congress, it has a rural and widespread geographic bias. These areas tend to be heavily conservative. This, coupled with the filibuster and the pretty much guranteed certainty that the dems are fucked in the midterms, means that Congress is basically a no go. We can't get shit through there. Even with our majorities, i doubt we will see Roe codified into federal law, because of these structural problems and obstructionism.

Can this be overturned in 2024? I doubt it. Republicans are actively attacking election infrastructure, and something like the Green Bay Sweep or another Jan 6 refusal to certify or some other coup attempt may lead to the overturning of a legitimate presidential election, or hell, the republicans might actually win. Last time Trump was in power, there were establishment figures that blocked him from being too destructive. I am not a pre-establishment kinda guy, but they did help prevent shit from going off the rails with Trump. They're all gone now. The folks that blocked his efforts to overturn the election? They're gone. Election officials are fleeing in droves, replaced by Trumpets.

Most americans are not conservative, the majority of americans are liberal or independent but tend to vote liberal. The majority of americans didn't want to see Roe overturned. But here we are. It seems likely that the right effectively have implemented minority rule for the foreseeable future. Elections favorable to dems will be ""rigged against republicans"" and unpleasant results (for republicans) thrown out, progressive legislation may be overturned by the courts which are now and will likely remain heavily right wing for the rest of our lives, etc.

Basically, what I am saying is the right won. They just have. And now a lot of people are screwed as a result. And to be frank, I'm fucking furious.

&#x200B;

So, where do we go from here?

I have a proposal, but I wanted to hear your thoughts.

The federal government is basically a non-starter. We're fucked there. Best we can do is maintain the stalemate with Republicans and use the filibuster to our advantage (prevent the worst of their excesses).

We need to realize what the republicans have. That real change is happening at the state level. Focus on state level politics as opposed to federal. There we actually have a chance at change. Why do we even need the federal government for large progressive programs? It's because they control a lot of resources. Most blue states are some of the most economically productive regions of the country. There's no reason multiple states couldn't band together and set up and inter-state shared finance pool for social programs like healthcare. The more richer states involved, and the more people involved, the more leverage such a pseudo-single payer/public option would have.

But we also have to recognize that republicans play dirty, and will probably be able to screw up state level stuff too. How do we counter this? Operate outside the state. Why is this possible? Don't we want to tax the rich and such? Yeah, we do. But I don't really think that's gonna be workable within the current political climate. We should keep trying of course, but we can't hold out for the state to save us. Capital bought it off long ago. Our rights must come from us and our work not that of bought and sold politicians trapped in a minority rule government. Our politics are fundamentally based in liberation and freedom, theirs require coercion (banning gay relationships, abortion, etc). Nobody is coming to save us, we have gotta do it ourselves.

No more of this ""they go low, we go high"". It doesn't fucking work. We sit on the laurels of our ""moral superiority"", they get what they want. It's bullshit. I don't care about compromising or appeasing the worries and whims of right wingers anymore. Rights are non-negotiable, and they will be protected. Sorry if that hurts the feelings of any right wing snowflake reading this. I just don't care about appeasing you anymore.

\-----------------------------------------

Specifically, I was thinking:

1. Community defense. Policing in this country is extremely problematic. Many POC don't feel comfortable calling the police. So how do we deal with this without any legislative change (cause that faces severe opposition and compromises we can't make)? To me, community defensive cooperatives seem to be the best solution. Set up a local cooperative, and get community members involved since they are best equipped to understand their community. The details of this would vary from town to town, but the idea is we have set up an alternative system for people who feel unsafe. Plus, given the sheer number and size of right wing Fascist militias, these community defense groups would be better able to respond to far right threats against POC than the cops because oftentimes cops have been infiltrated or are sympathetic or do nothing to stop these folks (cough cough Rittenhouse).

&#x200B;

2. Community insurance. The idea is based in mutual aid. Basically, there could be a consumer cooperative (basically a firm owned by its customers, kinda like a credit union). The idea is that this would basically be a pool of money that everyone pitches in. Those in desperate need could draw from it. The exact rules for this would be set by the consumers. Think of it as insurance, but not for profit, and with policies under direct control of consumers, and thus more favorable to them. The biggest issue is definitely finance, as where this is needed most are areas with the least financial resources. I am not really sure how to solve this under than mutual aid.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

3. Unionization drives. This speaks for itself, but a lot of the problems Americans have are rooted in not making enough to pay for shit, as real wages haven't grown while costs of living have gone up. The goal here is higher wages.

&#x200B;

4. Housing cooperatives. We are stuck with the shitty   rules of single family zoning as that is really only a problem the government can solve, cause they created it (so much for GOP ""free markets"", though in fairness i think the freest markets are market socialist so....). So in the meantime, we ought to focus on reducing individual housing costs. r/cooperatives has more info on housing cooperatives, but the goal is to reduce individual cost by spreading the burden across many people.

&#x200B;

5. Focusing on local business. Whenever possible, shop local. I am a massive hypocrite here cause I use Amazon a lot, but all the same it is better to shop local. This takes money and power away from the rich asshats funding right wing media operations and the like.

&#x200B;

6. Continue to disrupt and protest. Right wingers complain about ""free speech"" a lot. They don't know what the term actually means. Protesting is a form of speech and is protected by the 1st amendment. Use that right. Make it clear that white Nationalists and fascists aren't welcome in our communities. Boo, chant, wave signs, counter protest, etc. They will and do do it to us. It's only fair we return the favor.

&#x200B;

7. Fucking VOTE!!!! Community defense can play a role here too. Right now the Qult is trying to limit access to voting rights and undermine the vote by having ""poll watchers"" and stuff. Fine. They do that match them at their own game. We can ""poll watch"" to ensure our community members are safe and not intimidated by thugs when they go to vote.

&#x200B;

8. Volunteer and help when possible.  Soup kitchens, homeless shelters, whatever helps out the community go do it. It a) helps people and b) strengthens community bonds. There are a lot of homeless people out there who have psychological disorders, or were kicked out for being lgbtq+ (something like 40% of homeless youth are trans, I will let you guess the leading cause of their homelessness).

&#x200B;

9. ***Don't bury your head in the sand***. (I see this all the time here. It needs to stop) This flag: [https://www.miamitimesonline.com/opinion/the-no-quarter-flag-and-its-threat-to-america/article\_0e7221c0-46eb-11ec-8195-e7b68bed1e86.html](https://www.miamitimesonline.com/opinion/the-no-quarter-flag-and-its-threat-to-america/article_0e7221c0-46eb-11ec-8195-e7b68bed1e86.html) is being flown more often and in the open. There are many many people in this country who literally want to kill liberals and POC. I am not saying all right wingers want that or whatever. But a disturbing number do (a loud minority I suppose but even they are terrifying). Or this: [https://youtu.be/JOLhk-kDasc](https://youtu.be/JOLhk-kDasc). Notice the language. It isn't ""have to"".

Longer terms for politicians leads to better government. If legislators were elected for terms of 11 years then the democracies would enjoy much better leadership than what they currently get. 

Some argue, “If the voters can’t punish the politician at an upcoming election, why would that politician behave well while in office?” Here they unthinkingly invoke the so-called “retrospective” model of voting, in which the electorate is supposed to be “a rational god of vengeance and of reward.” In this model, the voters keep track of what a politician does, and then rewards them with re-election if the politician did well, or punishes them if the politician did not do well. And yet, the evidence is overwhelming that, in real life, the majority of voters do not keep track of what politicians are doing. Achen & Bartels, in Democracy For Realists, devote much of their book to showing how deeply flawed the so-called “retrospective” model of voting really is.

But if the retrospective model doesn’t work, then what does? Worldwide, the democracies are clearly more responsive to the public than the autocracies, and if the elections are not the main reason, then what is? 

Politicians can be made to do what the public wants only by a system of checks and balances. It’s only a small exaggeration to say that a nation’s politics will be an expression of the nation’s institutions, including all educational and civil and religious and also governmental institutions. While voting is part of that system of checks and balances, research suggests that it is currently one of the weakest (but with some changes it could be the strongest). Newspapers and media are more important than voting. Labor unions are essential. Other civic groups and NGOs are important. And conflict among elite groups opens up important avenues through which less powerful groups can demand accountability from the system, as the less powerful groups can join a coalition supporting one of the more powerful elite groups, and then if that elite group wins, the less powerful group also wins. It's the whole system that brings pressure to the politician and the politician's behavior is shaped by that entire system. The evidence is strong that voting is only a small part of the system whereby citizens can make their desires known.

What’s crucial is this: if a weak group manages to elect a representative who is willing to do battle on behalf of that weak group, then short terms in office only weaken that representative, and therefore help keep the weak group permanently weak. Longer terms at least allow the elected representatives to go out and fight. If workers want to elect someone who will fight against the political influence of the corporations, they should keep in mind that the average CEO holds the role for 7 years and the most powerful CEOs hold their roles for 12 years. And that is how long a representative needs to be elected for, if they are to fight as an equal against the CEOs. 

Just as important, when leaders are elected to short terms, they face pressure to pander to short-term interests. Leaders elected to longer-terms would be able to take on long-term issues, such as a climate change, issues that tend to be sacrificed to short-term concerns.

is a phrase that was used by many Germans after WWII, claiming they had no knowledge of the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime. The same principle can be observed today in the context of people discriminating against those who did not want to take part in a human experiment and did not comply with absurd rules that had no scientific basis.

No, what is happening here cannot be directly compared to the events that took place 80 years ago. History does not repeat itself, but it can indeed rhyme. People never change. There is a minority of people who discriminate against others, a majority who knowingly look the other way, and a minority who are discriminated against and fight against injustice.  


[Richard Ebright](https://twitter.com/R_H_Ebright)   wrote, for example, that ""the unvaccinated need to be excluded from public spaces, businesses, and schools."" - 127 people liked that fascist comment, which reminds me of the 1930s.   


[Sean Tendle](https://twitter.com/SeanTrende)   wrote that ""if you aren't vaccinated and other people need an ICU bed, we should unplug you, throw you in the family station wagon, and wish you luck."" - 417 people liked that tweet.    


[George Takei](https://twitter.com/GeorgeTakei)   tweet stated that ""willfully unvaccinated people who end up in hospitals from Covid should not receive priority medical care"" and received more than 35,000 likes. 

&#x200B;

[Steve Cox](https://twitter.com/RealSteveCox) who said they ""should be allowed to shoot"" the unvaccinated to take precautions to help protect others. This tweet, also containing Nazi-rhetoric, also garnered many likes.   


 

Over the past three years, authoritarian governments and shadow governments worldwide would never have been able to go so far if the majority had not looked away, or if those who spread misinformation and discriminated against dissenters were not encouraged to do so. At the very latest, when we were massively censored, deplatformed, and dismissed, ordinary citizens should have realized that something was going completely wrong; not to mention that the logic of the narrative (i.e., my mask and vaccination only work if you also get vaccinated and wear a mask) appears illogical even to a small child.

Turning a blind eye and yielding to repression is dangerous for several reasons. First, it erodes the foundations of a free society, allowing authoritarian regimes to gain power and control over people's lives. Second, history has shown that once we give away some freedoms, the regimes take more until there is no freedom left. Third, when individuals and communities are silenced and oppressed, the collective voice of society is weakened, making it difficult for positive change and reform to take place. How often have we heard the phrase ""these are only temporary restrictions of freedom"" from those who advocated for lockdowns?

Things will not end here. There will be no U-turn. The new protagonists are already in position and will propagate climate emergencies and restrictions on freedom for the climate. The CO2 passport will come and serve a similar function to the vaccination passport. People would never have agreed to these measures, so they had to be sensitized to Covid, an invisible enemy. These restrictions are coming step by step. No government worldwide will voluntarily return fundamental rights to its citizens. That is precisely why it is essential for us, independent citizen journalists and responsible citizens, to raise our voices and put pressure on governments. It is not too late to avert the seemingly inevitable.

By the way, it is bizarre that the very people who call themselves anti-fascist have been the loudest in demanding restrictions on freedom, forced vaccinations, and the exclusion of the unvaccinated, as well as the canceling of dissenting voices under the premise ""The unvaccinated are our misfortune."" And this tweet will be reported again by the ""allegedly good"" (especially German left-wing ANTIFA extremists), because there is nothing worse for them than having the mirror held up for what they have done and, above all, for what they are capable of doing.

It is also strikingly ironic that the very individuals who devote much of their energy to condemning ""misinformation"" are, in fact, often oblivious to the misinformation they themselves propagate. This unintentional perpetuation of falsehoods serves to further divide society and hinder the pursuit of truth, ultimately enabling the same discriminatory and oppressive behaviors they claim to oppose.

As we stand at the crossroads of history, let us remember: It is our collective responsibility to defend the principles of freedom, equality, and justice for all, regardless of the challenges we face. We must learn from the past and not let the mistakes of previous generations define our future. Together, we can shape a world where everyone's rights are respected and protected.

And for those who claim afterward that they knew nothing and didn't participate, let it be known that both the internet and my archive never forget.

10o0i0d,Libertarian,The Two Parties,OlyRat,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/10o0i0d/the_two_parties/,"The other day I came to the conclusion that the Democratic Party is best understood as a powerful political machine poised to ally with the majority of corporate-media power to become the dominant political power in America. They are likely to build a highly regulated social democrat government system with support from entrenched economic elites who can adapt to and profit from that system at the expense of dissidents and small economic actors. They will probably increase speech restrictions while monitoring individuals activities and finances electronically on a level we can hardly imagine, but the Republicans will present such an awful alternative they will act as a welcome force driving majority support to the Democrats.

The Republican Party is best understood as a weakening political force with shrinking, but highly committed, support from certain geographic areas and corporations. They are positioned to become more violent, undemocratic and irrational as a victimized perpetual opposition party. Rather than offering a functional alternative to the Democrats' vision they will simply criticize and undermine it while drawing support from whatever groups suffer materially or ideologically from the Democratic Party's agenda. Through internal squabbles, Democratic propaganda and a likely increased alliance with bigots and extremists they will fail to gain sufficient support to win the presidency or control the House or Senate.

This has convinced me that supporting either party will feed into one or the other side of a struggle that could easily end in a Republican-led coup or Democrat single party rule given enough time and dysfunction. The only hope is that the Republicans completely reform as a viable modern alternative to the Democrats, something they have no indication of doing, or a new party rises to better challenge the Democrats. 

I apologize for the long ass post, but I think this is important to think about. I really do think a third party is the best option, but I doubt the Libertarian Party or Greens have what it takes. Do you see a way the Libertarian Party could reform to be viable? Do you have any ideas about how we can prevent my prediction from coming true?

We carry a new world in our hearts, but not only there!

The December uprising sounded the alarm in the elites of authority. The adaptation of the state strategy to times [SK1] of crisis but also militant popular resistance shaped the doctrine of total control and preventive counterinsurgency. The escalation of state terrorism included a number of processes: the rise of fascism/nazism, concentration camps for immigrants and their murder at the borders, the total devaluation of workers' lives, the dismantling of public health care, laws restricting demonstrations and strikes, the control of life in universities, and much more. At the cutting edge of the repressive action of the state is also the attack on occupied spaces and the anarchist movement. The current government, continuing and upgrading the work of all the previous ones, exposed its intentions initially with the ultimatum issued by former minister Chrysochoidis to attack all occupied spaces. When they realized that the strategy of a single attack produced much more resistance [SK2] than fear, they abandoned this plan, changed the head of the Ministry of Repression and engaged in gradual raids [SK3] throughout the country.

The political direction of the government is obvious and becomes even clearer when one realizes who it is addressing in the run-up to the elections - exclusively the far right and the most conservative sections of society, those who are far from any process of social mobilization and are informed exclusively by the controlled media. Part of this attack was the eviction [SK4] of our squat ""Mundo Nuevo"" at dawn on Monday 28 November, a few days after the 7 years of its creation and also a few days before the anniversary of the revolt of December 6.

It is often said that these attacks are done solely to tickle the ears of the far-right or to change the political agenda and draw attention away from the wiretapping, the scandals, the evictions, the off-shore companies of MPs, their involvement in pedophile networks and many other miraculous things that have surfaced again recently. Even if this is true to some extent, in our view these are only secondary consequences and not the cause of the persecutors' fury. The state attacks squats because they are structures of struggle that actively and dynamically support class and social resistance, shape [SK5] consciences, give space and a way for sections of youth and other social groups to express themselves, to socialize, to struggle. They are a huge political problem for any government, an open wound to the institution of property on which the state and the present capitalist world is based.

We often write about what squats are and we refer to libraries, theatre, cinema, events, concerts and much more. And of course they are indeed all of those things. After all, how could there be social activists without their songs, theatrical performances, speeches and books? As long as we have identified our daily lives with the struggle for a better world itself, all of the above is self-evident. As is the fact that Mundo Nuevo has also been literally the home of many of us who have lived in the house. Yet beyond all this, Mundo Nuevo is the great home of Organized Anarchism, it is the political home of our plans for organizing resistance, for our most effective intervention to overthrow the existing power structure. Within the occupied space we have shaped our conception of our struggle, our intervention in the social fields, organized our action in the universities, promoted student initiatives, supported the workers' resistances, decided to spread to the neighborhoods. That's how we contributed to the big outbursts like the students in the occupied deanery, that's how we organized the 3d libertarian festival that was such a big trouble for the government that it decided to disband it at the risk of killing people who attended its concerts. Because of the Coming together as comrades and with other comrades we made it possible that the black and red flags of Anarchy are never missing from any mobilization in recent years, while the libertarian blocs are becoming more and more dense, so much so that the numerous and reinforced forces of repression are unable to surround them, to eliminate [SK6] them.

Just as they can't eliminate us. What we sowed for so many years in Mundo Nuevo has already taken root. All the demonstrations say so, for Pavlos Fissas and Alexis, for 17 November and women's liberation, for the workers’ strikes, the students who are fighting. The state leaders and government apologists know very well all these things, they know that it is the radical and anarchist movement, the grassroots resistances that have put serious obstacles in their way in the process of destroying and plundering our lives, as no party, no opposition, official or otherwise, has done. Nea Smyrni, the occupied Dean’s Office of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, the big demonstrations and the contact of thousands of people with radical politics and actions shook and frightened them again. And it is again the ghost of December that they have to exorcise. That is why they are striking us.
Yes, of course we have always had and still have a new world in our hearts, but it is not only there. It is [SK7] in what we have already made, in what has already been created and made its way into the vast river of raging freedom we call Anarchy. Young and old comrades continue the struggle unceasingly and that is what we will certainly continue to do. First and foremost by reclaiming Mundo Nuevo. The struggle for recovery has just begun and we call on the whole movement nationwide and abroad to support this cause, because it is not only about us but about the whole radical, anarchist and squatter movement. We warn at the same time the Municipality of Thermi not to be a carrier of the government of violence and authoritarianism and to put out of its mind thoughts of alleged ""exploitation"", which, apart from the rest, are also obvious lies, when the police authorities themselves have already done serious damage to the building, while they have completely isolated it with tons of sheet metal.

We call on all radical organizations, groups and collectives, women's initiatives, trade unions, student groups and associations, student associations to issue statements condemning the raid and eviction, we call on all progressive people of the city to stand with us against state terror and imposition. We never back down - Victory will be ours.

P.S. Forty-four (44) banners, according to the cops, were found inside Mundo Nuevo. That is nothing, not even one percent of what we have done to stand with the oppressed of this world.

10x3kku,Anarchism,Self harm and narratives of self harm in Capitalist societies.,Neferare,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/10x3kku/self_harm_and_narratives_of_self_harm_in/,"Writing to preserve my thoughts more than anything.

It may seem obvious to most that the system we are forced to interact with under threat of sanctioned state violence or homelessness is maladjusted. It does not fit the needs of those it claims to serve and for the vast majority only supplies them with their basic needs while stagnating their aspirations and personal interests. 

In order to fit into a maladjusted society people must adapt and in doing so they self harm on a level that would put any societal disease to shame. 

Would hold that the overwhelming majority of (medical) drug (ab)use from painkillers to sleeping tablets, ritalin not to mention caffeine, alcohol, tobacco and other narcotics is to assist in maladjusting to accommodate the demands of a maladjusted society. This self harm is an epidemic of epic proportions and having ""adapted"" to heightening the risk of heart disease and cancer only contributes further, cascading inward upon itself, compounding problems and contributing to further societal ills. 

What aspects of this culture can we see, creeping into our lives redefining, ""normalcy""? 

Do you punish yourself for, ""sleeping late""? Internalising the view of yourself as being ""unproductive"" for doing so, while in reality having given your body all the time it needs to rest? 

Do we put conditions onto children diminishing their worth and value with capitalist worker induced statements such as, ""I don't have the time""? 

In what ways culturally and other than what can be directly evidenced in the abuse of medical drugs do we harm ourselves in order to fit into a maladjusted society? Can highlighting these mannerisms help unroot an enslaved attitude and outlook enough to help others do the same and reject such maladjustment?",7,3,1675873446.0
vt2zsv,Anarchism,"A Community Conversation About Language, and an AutoModerator Update",TheNerdyAnarchist,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/vt2zsv/a_community_conversation_about_language_and_an/,"Hi friends,

We wanted to have a community conversation surrounding the language we use to refer to each other, how it’s moderated, and an update we are making in order to foster a better discourse in here. 

As you know, the Anti Oppression Policy is the guideline to moderation here. We follow this policy, as adapted by the community as a whole because as Audre Lorde said, “I am not free while any woman is unfree, even when her shackles are very different from my own.” 

One of the lies that capitalism teaches us is that our value as humans is dependent on our ability to perform in measurable ways. Capitalism also tells us that it's possible for some people to be superior or inferior, that some measures of ability are intrinsically more valued, and more valuable than others. Further capitalism has created and is perpetuated by a multitude of oppressive hierarchies that police our gender identities and creates a system of social value that place man at the top and all others below and thus subjugated and able to be controlled by him. 

We reject these notions. Rather we make our spaces safe for people who are subjugated and marginalized by the lies of capitalism and the state by not repeating and replicating the harmful notions of the capitalist lie, which is expressed through language and the words that we use to speak to and about each other. 

We’ve worked for a long time to keep this place free of language that reminds people that in the capitalist world, they are viewed as lesser. We’ve always removed the obvious things, but we wanted to talk today about the more hidden, insidious things that seem to plague even the most mindful of spaces; ableism and gendered language. 

While there is no automod or moderation change, we first ask for a conscious effort to avoid gendering people in your posts or comments. The patriarchy suggests the masculine as neutral, because the feminine could never be. This is because to be considered feminine is to be considered less than. When we neutralize masculinity to encompass every human in a way that we do not do for femininity we perpetuate sexism and sexist exploitation, and entirely invisibilizes people who do not identify with either gender. This is to say that regardless of everyone else in your personal life that you refer to as ""bro"" and ""dude"" and ""my guy"" (from your mother, to your couch, to your nonbinary best friend) we ask that you avoid doing so here. This ask includes being mindful of pronouns. Unless you are certain, we ask that you use the neutral they/them until and unless corrected. There is no good reason for us to have to deal with moderation of gendered pronouns in (this, the year of our lord and savior Murph the Nurf mascot) 2022. 

Secondly, we have updated the automod to delete posts that use the word st/pid. 

The goal with this shift in policy application is not to stifle conversation, but rather to remind ourselves to talk about others in a way that recognizes both the full humanity of the person you're referring to and the full scope of human ability, which is often intrinsically linked to not only our physical capabilities, but also is informed by the enculturation we have retained, with the politics we've been exposed to, with our access to granular information, with our ability to understand difficult concepts, none of which dictates superiority or inferiority. 

We do this because we are listening to the voices of people who identify and organize as disabled, who have been telling us that the language we use around intellectual ability is harmful, even when we ""don't mean it that way."" They still hear it and it remains language that is used to strip them of their humanity and to deny them autonomy and liberation through lack of access and accessibility. When we use the same language to denigrate a person's ability based on intellectual capacity we mirror the oppressive systems of capitalism by separating those who are worthy of being valued and those who are not. How can we claim to be working toward and fighting for a society where we are all liberated when we can't be bothered to ensure that those who are marginalized find safety in our company? And that anarchism is not friendly to people who are disabled under capitalism is not a new criticism. 

As we are a space absent of physical cues of communication, being online in a mostly text format, we only have the language that we use to express ourselves and our views, and to show others who we are and what we find valuable. To quote Autistic Hoya's essay on Violence in Language: Circling Back to Linguistic Ableism

\-----

#### Our evolution

**Theo:** I’m skeptical that just because we did something for a long time in our evolution that it means it would provide us the most meaning in life to keep doing it, it may be less stressful in the same way that challenging yourself to read complicated philosophy might be frustrating at times, but I still view passion for technical fields as producing more important happy flourishing for most people, regardless of suffering.

Evolution is a process of tinkering, finding whatever new mutated DNA will do the job of solving a problem. Our closest relatives chimpanzees and bonobos both have radically different social structures, which can’t clearly be explained by a long evolution of settling on a rigid psychology which is the most advantageous for each, but instead by theory of mind and how their brains have developed the capabilities to chose to form different social structures to manage social problems specific to their biological capabilities and their environment.

So the evolution of our biological capabilities created values, the ability for things to matter to us. But, what values we choose is up to us and it’s mostly going to be a case of grappling with why our parents and neighbors structured the environment in such a way for our development, whether we learn to agree with that choice or develop on their or someone else's ideas to change things for the next generation.

**Normandie:** The position regarding the way we evolved to be fulfilled is not an argument that there ought be a rigid psychology or way of doing things. It is that creatures evolve very gradually over a long period of time. Human beings have been essentially thrust into the industrial age, which is so much different in all aspects of life that it does have an impact on people. While everyone certainly has differences in what they seek in life and the archetypes they become, there are general things which are crucial to human well-being. Some of these are basic, such as regular exercise (the importance of which cannot be overstated), healthy sleep, exposure to nature, a healthy diet, etc. Just with the sedentary lifestyle of the modern man, most people are lacking in a major factor for our psychological health. However, one of the most crucial aspects of fulfillment is nearly totally deprived from us industrial civilians, that being the ability to go through what Kaczysnki called ‘The Power Process’. In short, people need to have goals whose attainment require effort, and they need to have reasonable success in attaining at least some of these goals, and some portion of the population has to have autonomy in the selection and attainment of their goals. Of course most people have goals whose attainment requires effort, but the basic necessities of life are so easily attained by going through the motions to get and work a job, that these serve little to no fulfillment of the power process. The means to secure our physical necessities are so alienated from what we have evolved to do that they leave one empty, even when these are attained, and people have little to no autonomy in these goals. They work the orders of their boss handed down from above. Even freelancers and business owners are beholden to the demands of their economic niche. So, people select surrogate activities to try and emulate the power process, which are ‘artificial’ goals that one sets for themselves in an attempt to emulate the power process. Surrogate activities are not inherently bad, and they do offer some amount of filling for the hole left by the absence of the power process, but the problem is when surrogate activities alone try to completely replace the power process.

Some have little to no distressing symptoms of modernity, and this is mostly because there is a segment of the population which adapts easier to these industrial conditions. Industrialized nations have an incredibly high rate of suicide, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, copious mood disorders and ‘personality disorders’, etc. Within those nations, just being in an urban area doubles the rate of schizophrenia. Some people are better at adapting to the industrial world than others, but for those who aren’t and exhibit natural symptoms of incongruity between the way we evolved to live and the way we live today, the diagnosed get separated, labeled, processed, and dealt with by being pharmacologically neutralized with drugs like antidepressants, which are a chemical lobotomy. On top of that, we are provided with a myriad of distractions to placate us, entertainment media, drugs, consumerism, etc, that many are able to pacify their distress their entire lives without being significantly disrupted by psychological distress in their functions in the industrial economy.

I do not claim that technical skills cannot be fun and enjoyable because many of them are. However, given what I just outlined regarding the power process and the fact that technical skills necessitate the techo-industrial system which I believe has inevitable terminal dangers, I don’t think that the fun of some of these technical skills are worth the disastrous fatal effects of industrialism for the ecology of the Earth, human freedom, or human existence, not to mention the overwhelming negative effects of industrialism on people’s mental and physical health.

#### Jacques Elluls’ influence on Kaczynski

**Theo:** Except for the not voting, I have no issue with Ellul, he was a Christian left-anarchist who desired to create a:

>“...Proudhonian socialism...by transforming the press, the media, and the economic structures...by means of a federative cooperative approach..."" an Anarchist society based on federation and the Mutualist economics of Proudhon.

I even agree with his take on technology I think, in that he thinks:

>The solution is to simply view technique as objects that can be useful to us and recognize it for what it is, just another thing among many others, instead of believing in technique for its own sake or that of society. If we do this we ""...destroy the basis for the power technique has over humanity.""

I would like people to use technology sparingly in their personal life through the concept of minimum viable use and community tool sheds to have a much lower impact on the environment.

I don’t think efficiency should be the goal and I think we should advocate eco-centrist philosophy and policies which starts with the foundation of; in order to even know where it is ethical to draw a line in the sand on where and what amount of territory can be taken up by human development, we need to look to where environmental processes can and cannot support sentient life and to what degree.

**Normandie:** I think that Ellul’s work, *The Technological Society*, is an incredibly important work for understanding a lot about the techno-industrial system. However, I disagree with his conclusions about what must be done and find his idea that we can take some parts of industrialism and leave the rest to be naive. This is where Kaczysnki comes in, who has written about why this is not the case in a robust way in *Anti-Tech Revolution: Why and How*.

#### Can people choose how society is run when machines are involved?

**Theo:** Kaczynski has a view of history where when society changes, and the side-effects are unknown, we rationalize that we desired those side effects in the first place and planned for them through a desire for efficiency or the pursuit of knowledge, but that we begin to reflect systems of machines, rather than them being simple tools of our own desires.

I agree that there can be a kind of manufactured consent situation going on in the way a kid can through social pressure be coerced into buying the latest iphone.

But, I disagree that we need to return to the middle or stone ages levels of technology to solve this problem. I would always want to put time and effort into building assembly lines for life changing items like penicillin and seeing glasses.

We don’t need to conceive of society as a network of rational social contracts either for using technology to make sense. From ‘The Politics of Postanarchism by Saul Newman’:

>However, can we assume that the possibilities of human freedom lie rooted in the natural order, as a secret waiting to be discovered, as a flower waiting to blossom, to use Bookchin’s metaphor? Can we assume that there is a rational unfolding of possibilities, driven by a certain historical and social logic? This would seem to fall into the trap of essentialism, whereby there is a rational essence or being at the foundation of society whose truth we must perceive. There is an implicit positivism here, in which political and social phenomena are seen as conditioned by natural principles and scientifically observable conditions. Here I think one should reject this view of a social order founded on deep rational principles. In the words of Stirner, ‘The essence of the world, so attractive and splendid, is for him who looks to the bottom of it – emptiness.’ In other words, rather than there being a rational objectivity at the foundation of society, an immanent wholeness embodying the potential for human freedom, there is a certain void or emptiness, one that produces radical contingency and indeterminacy rather than scientific objectivity. This idea has been elaborated by Laclau and Mouffe, who eschew the idea of society as a rationally intelligible totality, and instead see it as a field of antagonisms which function as its discursive limit. In other words, what gives society its definitional limit at the same time subverts it as a coherent, whole identity. Therefore, they argue, ‘Society never manages fully to be society, because everything in it is penetrated by its limits, which prevent it from constituting itself as an objective reality.’ Antagonism should not be thought of here in the sense of the Hobbesian state of nature, as a war of everyman against everyman, but rather as a kind of rupturing or displacement of social identities that prevents the closure of society as a coherent identity.

**Normandie:** Kaczysnki’s views on the development of human societies is that they cannot be rationally controlled, that is that people cannot impose a change on society for the long-term unless it is in line with a pre-existing historical trend, such as the gradual ‘democratization’ of the west. It is not just when machines are involved, but It is my opinion that the primary force driving human society in the modern world is not men or men’s profits. What drives humanity is an encompassing motivation, it is something that is a religion in the hearts of most men today. That is the technological system, technical development in all fields, in all facets, in all aspects of living, at all costs, for whatever end, and with whatever means, simply for the sake of doing it; if it can be done it must be done. Most technological developments appear to have more upsides than downsides in the immediate effects, so they will always be pursued whether or not they will be disastrous later on, which is hardly capable of being predicted. Men are not the shepherds of technology in the modern world, but are shepherded by the technological system. All technical developments are advantageous in natural selection, and are pursued. Industrial economies are a means to pursue, coordinate, plan, and engage in this totality of technical development.

The world is a large supersystem composed of many competing subsystems. In the short term, natural selection favors those that recklessly pursue advantages, even if those advantages are destructive in the long term. Those that are prudent for their long-term future are beat out by those that pursue advantages with little to no regard for long-term consequences. Let’s say for example that an anarcho-communist society with an attempt at rational prudence were to form successfully. Movements are always corrupted when they achieve their goals and can offer members of it status or power in some way. The idea that all people can be made to care about this altruistic prudence and not pursue reckless advantages at some point is a fantasy. Some actors at some point will pursue the destructive short term advantages for power, and they will beat out the prudent actors. If a movement is to achieve its goal, it needs to have a clear, concise, and concrete objective that once obtained will be irreversible, and it needs to achieve its goal quickly before corruption sets in. A convoluted vision of society that is easily reversible, such as keeping the ‘good parts’ of the industrial system and not utilizing the rest, is doomed to fail.

#### Does modern life erode our freedoms?

**Theo:** I campaign for people to have the autonomy to choose their own means in life, I want people to have the option of loads more wildlife habitat than currently exists, to live in if they want to. But I also want people to have the freedom to go to a worker owned business to fulfil their intellectual passions.

**Normandie:** I would absolutely love to spend my life minding my own business on my land with my community and not paying mind to how others live their lives. If I didn’t truly believe that industrialism has inexorable, terminal dangers for the future of humanity and the Earth, then I would just live my days on my homestead. I’m not a revolutionary because I don’t like cities or factories and want to impose my preferences on others. It is because I genuinely believe that if the industrial system continues to its conclusion, my children won’t have a place to live, they will be subjugated and changed beyond the point of any remaining human dignity or they will be extinct, along with the rest of the Earth’s ecology.

#### Is modern life unfulfilling?

**Theo:** He thinks people are trained to be over-socialized as a form of entertainment in service to technology, so political advocacy is just a surrogate activity, where people are trained to feel guilty for not helping people, to waste their time advocating others become more invested in the collectivist system.

I just disagree that it's an unfulfilling project or we should do it out of guilt. Being able to reach a point in our social evolution where we can care for the basic needs of everyone to a basic extent is a beautiful and satisfying goal to work towards and to sustain through living those communal relationships.

#### Has technology increased suffering?

**Theo:** It may have done, but I’m not a utilitarian who only cares about pain vs. pleasure, I think suffering is necessary for self-actualization, so achieving your goals and feeling a deeper happiness, which the stoics called eudaimonia which just means happy flourishing.

The foundations for any pleasure at all for disabled people and other innocent victims of disease and lack of basic security would be denied in any anti-tech revolution which took us backwards.

Ted thinks primitive man can handle these issues stoically, but why then cannot modern man do the same with technology in order to reap the benefits of innocent items like penicillin and seeing glasses?

#### Would industrial society re-emerge?

**Theo:** I’m sceptical of Kaczynskis’ confidence that a new industrial revolution wouldn’t simply re-emerge, especially with people passing down memories and books of all the benefits to modern life.

Firstly, the harm to the environment would be much worse than us simply transitioning to renewable energy and rewilding areas as we depopulate as is the trend in advanced countries. Secondly, I would argue the probability that we will achieve a long-lasting, mostly peaceful, technologically advanced, left-anarchist society is far more valuable to me than returning to an either never ending series of warring feudal societies or feudal societies that repeats the industrial revolution and has another series of world wars for resources.

Primitive life is more appealing to me personally than feudalism in that I could be born into a fairly egalitarian tribe like the Penan or that I wasn’t but I wouldn’t know any different life or if I had some of the egalitarian ideals I had now, the possibility would be there to strike out on my own and form an egalitarian tribe. But bar convincing everyone to be hunter gatherers, or technological incentives to have fair and democratic communication among societies who trade with each other, you just are going to recreate feudal era societies, where you’d have to be very lucky to escape from conscription and tyrants and the environmental destruction [could be far worse](https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2011/09/peat-and-coal-fossil-fuels-in-pre-industrial-times.html).

**Normandie:** Even if society were to at some point in the future begin the process of industrialization again, it is not sensible for us to worry about that. We must deal with the problems facing our time just as they will have to deal with the problems facing their time. If society were to industrialize again, it would most likely be some 500 or 1,000 years in the future. There are some people who even believe that it would not be possible to industrialize again because the conditions and resources that allowed for industrialization in the first place are no longer there. I’m not one of these people who think it is impossible, but it would certainly take hundreds of years or more to rebuild the system, both because the development of the system is a long and convoluted process and because of the lack of plentiful natural resources that were consumed in our time.

Just because there is a possibility that society industrializes again does not mean we should give up, because the alternative is destruction. The larger the system grows, the more disastrous the effects of its breakdown will be. If we do not bring it to collapse in time, we are facing a technological crisis that entails total ecological destruction. If we carry out a successful revolution in time, then there is at least a chance of humanity, and other complex living organisms, surviving.

#### What level of violence is justified to achieve this anti-tech revolution...

**... & How do you determine what direct action targets are justifiable today?**

**Zerzan:** I’m much more interested in critique than I am in tactics, but to me what’s really at the base of it, as it usually is, is the question of violence. What is violence and what is not violence? And I think my position is rather simple, it’s not violence if it’s not directed at some form of life, in other words you can’t violate a building in my view.

I mean friends of mine might disagree, I mean they would say yes it’s violence and we don’t shrink from violence and that’s a position too.

So, I just think that in general there are a lot of targets and you know I don’t think you can get too far finding answers to that question in the abstract, but I could be wrong.

**Theo:** It’s a complicated problem, I know some websites try to put together an aims and principles list to explain what actions they’ll report on and then I think that can influence what actions people take and what actions people think are justified.

You have people using slogans like ‘by any means necessary’ going all the way back to Malcolm X & Franz Fanon in the 60s, which I guess is an attempt to say we’ll go as far as we’re pushed, so be careful what state terror tactics you use on us.

I’ve experimented with writing up a [list of principles](https://www.thetedkarchive.com/library/theo-slade-an-experimental-list-of-anarchist-principles) for what direct action principles are necessary for different stages in history, in terms of peace time and when social tensions are at their height, of which one principle is; during a non-revolutionary period “never physically hurt people in order to achieve political goals as it runs counter to our philosophy on the left that material conditions create the person and so we should make every peaceful effort to rehabilitate people.” So, what do you think about those as an important foundation?

**Zerzan:** Well I’ll just mention that Kaczynski did refine his own view on that, I mean he apologized for that early crude bomb on the jetliner, he renounced that. I think the targets were relatively more appropriate as he went along, as they became more lethal, on that level anyway, I think you could argue that that’s the case.

And where is the effectiveness? I mean what success are you having or not having? I mean that can tell you something about what things to do or what things to avoid.”

**Theo:** And what would be the measurements of success for you do you think?

**Zerzan:** Well, I would say advancing the dialogue. I think that if your thing is mainly critique, it’s a question of the conversation in society, is there some resonance? Is there some interest? Is there some development going on there? In other words, I’m not afraid of certain tactics that people commonly shrink from. and they say well, ‘you’re just turning everybody off’, but sometimes I think you have to go through that stage if you will, I mean sometimes that comes with the territory, in other words, people will be defensive and horrified or whatever at first and then they won’t be. You know? Then it becomes part of the dialogue, you know then things change, they don’t remain the same. In other words, there can be shock at the beginning with some tactics, but that wears off, I think, I would assert that’s likely to be the case.

**Theo:** Right, and you’ve made the comparison between Kaczynski and John Brown in that way. The difference I would say for me though, in those two situations are that John Brown was six years away from the civil war and they were very much accepted at the time to be one of two sides fighting a guerrilla war, one for revolution and the other for conservatism. Kaczynski’s actions were in some ways asymmetrical warfare, but they didn’t have any snowballing effect, they weren’t strategic targets that scared people off from doing what they were doing.

Secondly, Kaczynski’s actions were taken during a non-revolutionary period in which I think physically hurting people to achieve political goals is bad. It’s bad precisely because the conditions weren’t right for revolutionary war.

For example, even if the revolutionary left got really good at assassinating captains of industry and getting away with it, there would be reasonable fears around the psychology of people who would take such an act against people who they could have grown up and been socially conditioned to be themselves, which would inexorably lead to a more authoritarian society and worse foundations on which to work towards a better society.

**Zerzan:** Well I was quite frankly surprised by the levels of sympathy that were spontaneously expressed in the US in the 90s, I was pleasantly surprised by that. Really, there was much much less horror, or there was horror at the bombings and stuff, but there was also a good deal of sympathy.

Like one case, my wife knew this woman at the business school at the university here, and this person commented on the media footage when they were taking him somewhere in Montana before they moved him to California. And he’s dressed, it’s a well-known deal, he’s got a sport coat on and you can tell he’s got a vest on underneath and he’s kind of looking up at the sky as he’s walking along. And her comment was; “why don’t they just put a cross on his shoulders?” In other words comparing him to Jesus for Christ’s sake, I mean that’s a little unexpected, especially from a rather ‘straight person’, who’s not an anarchist or anything of this sort.”

**Theo:** It was definitely a novel case, that’s for sure. But I think for the most part interest in the Unabomer case is comparable to other true crime curiosities such as the case of Aileen Wuornos.

I’m fascinated by Aileen Wuornos case, who was this hitch-hiking sex worker in the 70s, who ended up killing and robbing some of her clients, and it was this weird juxtaposition for the time because women were getting killed all the time by men and so it flipped the script a little bit that there was actually truck drivers who had assaulted or raped women on the road before, who began to be too afraid to pick up women because they were worried about getting killed.

>On hearing news on the radio of a woman sex worker killing men, one woman compared the unbelievable experience to the first time Orson Welles’ radio-play ‘The War of The Worlds’ was received by a bemused audience.

So, I’m fine with people finding a lot of value in his philosophy and he’s definitely an intellectual who has found a fairly good critique of modern civilization in 90% of his writings. I just worry that his effect on the world is going to be a stepping stone and to the right for a lot of people, so in terms of discussing his legacy we need to figure out ways to lay down some principles and say that what he did was chaotic and wrong, and we need we need these solid principles for direct action today, to lay the stepping stones for going forward today.

For example, I know you disagree with random bombings of the ITS tendency, but in terms of people agreeing with your philosophy on what kind of technology is likely bad which is very broad, this idea that any tool that requires a hierarchy of coordination and specialization is something to be avoided, are you not concerned that you could be promoting direct action which falls well outside ethical principles like the ones I laid out in my email to you, such that you run the risk of motivating someone to take direct action which makes your rebellion look insane and so lead people to wish to preserve the status quo or facilitate a move to a more authoritarian society?

I observed some important push back like the [Anarchist Federations response](http://afed.org.uk/statement-on-the-informal-anarchist-federation-tactics/) to an Informal Anarchist Federation cell kneecapping a nuclear physicist, where AFed critiqued the terrorist project of attempting to spread fear rather than building social movements and sometimes sabotaging what stands in our way, but always with the goal of winning strategic victories. Another important critique to add here, is that I don't think we should ever take actions based on the conspiratorial anti-industrial beliefs in the over-exaggerated dangers of industry such as fears of nuclear meltdowns in stable nations.

**Zerzan:** Well again, I’d say what is happening in terms of social movements now? I mean there’s very little right now, I could point to the anti-globalization years so-called, you know around 1999 to 2001 which was a pretty considerable thing, it’s kind of forgotten but I mean I don’t know, perhaps Kaczynski’s forgotten.

**Theo:** I still don’t think a strong argument has been given for justifying direct action which attempts to harm or kill people. And so, unfortunately I think for people who take this stance like yourself and Kaczynski, some important disclaimers need to be made whenever discussing your work if – as members of campaign groups, mutual aid networks and affinity groups – we want to recruit and maintain members or advocate others over to our political philosophy.",5,7,1669473836.0

yf9hiq,Anarchism,The Tenets of Anarcho-Pantheism: continued.,PlumbumGus,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/yf9hiq/the_tenets_of_anarchopantheism_continued/,"Part one of this document is linked below in the comments.



To further explore the tenets of Anarcho-pantheism, which have been established as confusing so far, I will need to address the appropriation of dogmatic terms for the purposes of attracting the ""right stuff"", as it were. To bring together the most disparate worldviews in a very immediate and communicable way. We can steal their religious words of power for our own purposes.  Much in the way one could dress down in apprehension of a riot, and you end up resembling riot police, you can dress yourself down in stolen theology to confuse and confound the enemy, (if in fact there is one), that would destroy the planet. 


This introduces the pantheism aspect into the dialogue, it simultaneously rejects dogma and seeks to create a diverse compendium of perspectives from fellow humans and scientists to enlighten the masses towards a joy that can be taken by working in accord with the universe. Instead of constantly resisting entropy we find a way to coexist with it. It creates the importance of God as a Non-Anthropomorphic Emergence; not as a Violent, Male, Omnipotent, Abstract Force. If words are fabrications of the mind, surely we can bear that in mind as we take back what's rightfully ours. These words that have been both abused and misused for far too long.


 A free-radical sort of freedom is needed that can be communicated to those who are in dire need of rescue from imprisoning and abusive dogmas of all sorts. And I believe that anarcho-pantheism is a viable, although confusing, approach towards that sort of therapy.


I must naturally address atheism as it is a constant and reinforcing presence in anarchy, and I do not begrudge it in the slightest, I only give the same warning to atheists that I give to all people; existing as one polar end of a binary thought, (belief vs disbelief, in this context), is just mentally and emotionally unhealthy**.  


**Here's where hearing from a fellow atheist and not a pantheist, like me, might be beneficial to present. A book called ""Living With a Wild God."" by Barbara Ehrenreich, details this woman's life, born into an atheist family, largely led an atheist- professional, activist, chemist, writer lifestyle, but admits (if you like) to having mystical experiences, I recommend this read for all atheists that are looking for a profundity to go with their objectivity.


If the mind is anything like the body, (and it is, go figure), it's pliable, it's flexible, it adapts; it can both believe and disbelieve as needs be. It can choose to be moral, it can choose to be virtuous, or it can choose the inverse of those things too. The point is to convey their agency in the process, the point is to stir their autonomy to good, beautiful and true movements, and failing at that, seek neutral ground, and, further failing at that, defending against their offenses with a protective use of force. (Preferably nonviolent)

v3oapi,Anarchism,"The Cuban Pride and False Dilemma. Written by Mel Herrera, 2021",cerrocerrao,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/v3oapi/the_cuban_pride_and_false_dilemma_written_by_mel/,"[**Original article**](https://revistaelestornudo.com/boric-chile-soberbia-falso-dilema-cubano/)



Boric won and Cubans, as it occurs when there’s elections in the region, we keep ourselves expectant, we make our analysis and prognostics, give our opinion and, what costs the most, we learn the complexity and the truths via democracy.


The exile is maybe the harshest. They demand of us all the time that we stop looking to such a site and concentrate in our dilemma that, in the end, is ours we must fix it ourselves. Why should pay attention to the elections of other countries of the region when there’s so much to do with ours? Well just for that; to take experiences of other countries in democratic transitions.


There’s no lack among us of those that give lessons about what we don’t have, and that is the most understood things in democracy, participation, elections, and pluri-partyism. They specialize in prognosticating and warning others of what will happen in their countries if they vote for the party or whatever candidate, as if the people of those places were deprived of self-agency and only us are the awarded ones with so called common sense. The worst we Cubans have is that we believe ourselves the last Bucanero of the Caribbean.


I don’t know what path will Chile take from now on. I also don’t know if Boric is the solution. I have the humility to admit that I do not the Chilean conflict and that my knowledge in politics can be very limited. I’ve learned everything via hits of disappointment, of experimenting that feeling of not belonging, of feeling comfortable in any nation project, because many of them leave outside other intersections of my body that is, at the end of the day, the only homeland I know, the territory that I defend above all.


If I was Chilean or resident in Chile, I would have voted for Boric without a second thought. To say it in a clumsier way, I sympathize with Boric because I don’t sympathize with Kast. That is to say, with nothing that resumes neofacism, pinochetism, colonialism, ultraright. Nothing that puts other demands of my body in a second or third steps of priorities or that annuls them just as the Cuban state has done. I sympathize with Boric because when I see the most putrid of the right, those white saviors in which some Cubans see freedom –Vox, Monasterio, Abascal, franquists, the Spanish Popular Party, Trump, Bolsonaro, their eagerness of recolonizing the dehumanized zones, of controlling the bodies and the sexualities, and that nostalgia of barracks and engines—I understand that there I cannot be, just as I also understand that those who sympathize with them do because they don’t see their most elemental privileges and rights threatened.


I understand the Cuban terror to “communism”; such a terror that anything that doesn’t meet the expectations or is in line with the political ideas of others is called “communism”. What **I don’t understand is that false dilemma of ours that often goes from escaping authoritarianism to seeking refuge in another, that only leaves two options, the most extremists always.** 
Not always is a known bad better than good to be known. We don’t know exactly what turn Chile will take with Boric. Everything that can be said is speculation and prejudices valued in accordance with our suffering, which doesn’t have to be centered or a measure in this case. However, we know perfectly well what was going to happen in Chile with Kast.


I prefer to risk myself for those who speak with fresh language, running the risk that later, like every revolutionary process, falls into statism, conservative positions or that it becomes what it took down. Those who have resisted political loneliness or disaffection do not believe in politicians or saviors. I will criticize Boric if he entertains the authoritarianisms and dictatorships of the Latin American left, and I will be following his plan of government. But **don’t ask me to sympathize with parties of the extreme right for the simple fact that they oppose the Cuban state and that they recognize it as a dictatorship, when those same parties show no sympathy for people like me nor for others also marginalized by the Cuban state.**
I write from the body that I inhibit that I can’t do from another site no matter how much I want. As a black transgender woman, I could never decide through parties and politicians that wish to exterminate me in different ways: annulling my rights, putting me back in the closet, keeping in the zone of “invisible lives” that Judith Butler talks about.


It is not a secret that the parties of extreme right are openly racist, xenophobic, anti-immigrants, anti-feminists, anti-science, LGBTphobic, and **it is a shame that after we have lived the eternal Cuban drama of crossing the stretch to Florida, of running to other places of the world, of experiencing the repression and the criminalization of political dissent, the precarious work, the structural racism, the UMAPs, we arrive at other countries and we ally ourselves with parties that sustain everything mentioned**, with the fairy tale of common sense, that rationality that is so euro western, want to destroy the state of welfare, the public assistance, anything that might hurt “communism” or social justice, and they are incapable of inventing a better alternative. 


I believe that Cubans we don’t flee from Castro nor from communism nor from hunger. **We flee from that low self esteem that follows us since times immemorial and that it costs us to acknowledge, but in many cases with take off from our cost to step on someone else and to take out how miserable we can be**. Vox and the Spanish Popular Party have wanted to abolish anti-discriminatory laws, and the Trans Law in Spain. I cannot feel complacent. However, for some I should be applauding because they are the parties that reject and recognize the political repression in Cuba. In summary, others that are not a danger to the democracy.


They will not annul me using counterparts as examples that are accepting of those ideologies. Vox exhibits its trans person and black person like festival clowns just to annul critical discourse. Being trans or black in it of itself does imply a conscience of what means to be it in a Eurocentric world and cis-hetero-patriarchal. A profound work must have been realized.



Just because I reject and oppose the state of affairs in Cuba doesn’t mean I will run into the arms of any political extreme. Turning to there doesn’t look very far from where we are. We can try what Paul Preciado says: **“Invent […] a new political imagination capable of confronting the logic of war, the heterocolonial reasoning and the hegemony of the market as site of production of value and of truth”**.
Some zones of the Cuban opposition, due to wear or whatever it is, lack imagination and creativity; they are stubborn and have known how to construct alliances nor come up with new language. They have not known to win over other bodies also in conflict with officialism, because to them they are also expendable identities and bodies. They design nation projects, movements and platforms that speak of plurality, and **it is the plurality that sustains the idea that all opinions are valid and respectable and that it is alright to sit in the same table irreconcilable positions to reach agreements in the name of the common good, it’s to say, that which is commonly good for the same of always, when we all know that in these agreements it is not them who sacrifice the most.**


They put, for example, the activism for the rights of sexual dissidence and of gender to dialogue with religious fundamentalism that wants to cut those same rights. They preach about liberty, democracy, take down the dictatorship… And I don’t what is all that, because those who ask for it the most also don’t know. **In the end, we return to what we have known for more than 70 years: authoritarianism, and that low national self esteem that makes us dependent on the United States or Europe, like someone that due to emotional dependency maintains a relationship with someone to which they do not matter, and don’t realize it.** That fascination for the North and that disconnect with the processes of the global South, with the people most impoverished and marginalized, like someone who spends all their time shaming their place of origin because they believe something different.


Why do they worry so much for black people, for the black political prisoners? **Why do they mention the color of the skin if they do not have much interest in that color seizing to be the color of the jails and of the victims of the political repression?** **Why do they do the act of worrying for the most marginalized Cuban neighborhoods and the impoverished people if the neoliberal economic model for which they yearn for will move these people from these zones?**


Why do they denounce the lack of legal guarantees of women and victims of gender violence if the parties that many love do not recognize the violence of gender and are profoundly anti-feminist? Why do they rip their clothes when a trans woman’s gender identity is not respected by the repressive bodies, if the parties they baby also want that?


The conservative anticastrists do not want that the people of sexual dissidence name themselves, because naming us implies signaling, due to situations that have nothing to do with our capacities, that access to a life of dignity is more difficult for us; disadvantageous situations to which they turn their backs, and which in the majority of cases they are also responsible for. But **when it comes to state violence against a trans woman, they name her in the headline. A black person is killed or roughed up and they are quick to denounce castrism, and the truth is that to many they do not care about black people, nor the jails, nor do they recognize their profound racism** and assume finished a conflict persisting for more than 500 years saying that we are all already equal, that only on race exists: the human, and however many messages of love and peace occurs to the to frustrate a more serious and profound debate.


**The problem of racism is not a problem of communism or of castrism. It is structural in any political-economical system, in any state nation. Many are not interested in the more ancient dictatorships, of patriarchy, colonialism, racism, but they already learned how to write patriarchy, colonialism and racism when comes to a political opponent.** What would’ve happened if the sexual aggressor Fernando Becquer was white and dissident? What would’ve happened if in place of Becquer the denounces of sexual aggression would’ve been against an opposition person, a director of an independent medium or an important anticastrist politician? Why the do they criticize castrism for that which in democracy also aren’t capable of fixing since they do not care and the struggles of gender, race, class, and other intersections are not priorities?



As I read yesterday after the triumph of Boric, **the right will have to adapt to social justice yes or yes, just like the left has to accept it will continue to live in capitalism.**


Many will tell me immediately that it is not all. Clear as day. Or they assure than in reality it is not that many Cubans that yearn for the return of colonial times, bastistians, franquistas or any other contradictory thing they demand: democracy, liberty, human rights, respect for all lives. At this point, I am not so convinced.


Later there are those that do not lawyer for these parties or political extremism but criticize whenever someone speaks of them. It’s giving them visibility, they say, and that we can concentrate energy in other things. The damned circumstance of authoritarianism everywhere. **The problem is that there’s always something that is more important. The rest, for later, and there is, in summarized accounts, a whole country that has been left for later.** Where they see they give visibility, I see counterspeech.


Fascism and all the forms of discrimination are combated. And it has to be said: not only did Boric and Chile win. When fascism is defeated in any of its forms, all that live in planet earth, us who have been displaced from the category “human”, and even the humans of always, win.",4,0,1654220126.0
11gdm3s,socialism,An important lesson from Orwell,titobroz99,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/11gdm3s/an_important_lesson_from_orwell/,"As everyone on this sub probably knows George Orwell was a socialist, he faught alongside Communists in the Spanish civil war and in his non-fiction works was highly critical of the U.S.; but as we all also know his books have been used as one of the main tools of both the U.S. and U.K. to spread anti-communist redirect and make the public associate Communism with authoritarianism; the right references his books regularly and the CIA even funded a movie adaptation for one of them. Despite Orwell being a soscialist and wanting to help the world achieve soscialism his books have been used to demonize soscialism and justify anti-communist interventions all around the world. I think we should also be careful to avoid this ""trap"", many anarchists and demsocs today will still post and talk negatively of the USSR and China; it's important before putting something out into the public to stop and think ""Would anti-communists agree with this? Could this be interpreted in a way that anti-communists would agree with?"" if the answer to either of those questions is yes you should probably keep it to yourself *or* word it in a way that makes it clear you still support soscialism just not something specific about how x group is trying/tried to implement it. Even Leninists and Maoists can fall into this trap, how often do we say things like ""liberals are such hypocrites"", ""liberals only care about winning elections"", or countless other statements about liberals that while completely true can sound pro-right wing if the context doesn't make it clear that your criticizing them *because they're too right wing*. Orwell (idealist and arguably traitorous as he was) never intended for his works to hinder the spread of soscialism but the right found a way to use them, let's make sure we don't say things that the right could appropriate.",3,29,1677790216.0

11y4fs3,socialism,Should socialists still care about CO2 emmisions?,vivamorales,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/11y4fs3/should_socialists_still_care_about_co2_emmisions/,"How do ""tipping points"" in global warming relate to our struggle? (If you need background on tipping points, consult this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxoyaCSWFGs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxoyaCSWFGs) ).

Here's my current thinking:

* Suffienct CO2 reduction is impossible under capitalism.
* Capitalism will be overthrown in the imperial periphery before the imperial core (in most cases).- Overthrowing capitlaism will take many decades in the imperial periphery, and even more decades in the imperial core.
* Therefore, capitalism will survive long enough for earth to inevitably hit carbon tipping points.
* Tipping points will trigger the earth to release more carbon than we humans ever could. Once we hit a handful of tipping points, all climate action on CO2 becomes meaningless. For example, there's no point greening our economies if the Amazon is self-deforesting because of droughts which cause more self-deforesting which cause more draughts... etc.

Conclusion:

* The left should abandon CO2 reduction.
* The left should pivot to climate adaptation & climate justice.
* The left should prioritize environmental issues in order of how impactful they are to public health.

... What do you guys think?  I know this sounds doomerist, but if you think I'm just being needlessly pessimistic, answer me a few questions:

1. What decade do you honestly think global socialism can be achieved?
2. What decade do you think the highest CO2 emmitting countries will abandon the capitalist mode of production?
3. After watching the video, how can you think tipping points are avoidable within this timeline?",0,11,1679453448.0

zr1xod,socialism,Why AI is the greatest threat to the Future of Mankind,flyfoxflybat,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/zr1xod/why_ai_is_the_greatest_threat_to_the_future_of/,"We are currently observing an upsetting dynamic in the world of visual art. Machine Learning Algorithms are capable of learning, through a diffusion process, to create and replicate art in ways that is not possible for human beings. 

How they do this is simple: They use data created by humans beings, in the form of visual information (images), to train a neural network to recreate that kind of data through the use of label prompts. As it stands, the data the corporations who are training and selling these models use can be aquired without license or consent. What this in practice means is that the labor value of that data, created by human beings who spent decades to perfect their craft, is extracted by the corporations who are in control of these AIs. The data produced by the people now fuels the imagination of the machines. The creativity of mankind is the oil, taken from them for free under the guise of the democratization of art. Stability AI, lead by former hedgefund manager Mohammad Emad Mostaque, has managed to spread this narrative very effectively. He conveniently omits that his company is now valued at 1 billion $. His so called open source project has extracted the value of thousands of artists, nullifying the worth of their labour while concentrating all that value at a handful of corporations.

Stability AI, or any similar corporation, will likely grow to become worth trillions eventually. Meanwhile, it will be argued that training AI is no different from humans learning from each other. That indeed, everyone is free to use data and learn from it however way they please. And of course, this applies to the machines and more importantly those who sit behind them. Yet, never before in the history of mankind was a singular individual capable of extracting the value of millions of artists, if not all artists, and concentrating all that wealth and creative power at one point. But of course, we are supposed to believe this is just the same. They say all art is derivative, after all.

&#x200B;

They will argue this is for the good of creativity. That this will give more humans access to self-expression. Now, I will not go into the details of why the commodification of art leads to the destruction of the very purpose of art, and why allowing the machines to replace our imagination is a terrible idea. Instead, I want to demonstrate that none of this will actually lead to the democratization of art. That instead, all we are doing is preparing a future in which the powerful will be in control of all creative output.

At first glance it seems very appealing, does it not? Giving everyone infinite freedom to create anything they please. Sure, jobs will be replaced, but artists will adapt with the times and use the machines as tools, will they not?

Short contemplation reveals that this only works as long as everyone is given access to the AIs. Today, you can run these MLA's on your own computer, if you have a graphics card that has enough compute power. However, it's only a matter of time before these AIs will grow more sophisticated. What we are observing today is child's play, we are barely learning how to crawl. At some point they will be so complex and compute intensive that only those with enough ressources will be able to run them. They will become so valuable that giving away access to them will be irrational. Why do we assume the future mega-corporations would care about human artists, if they can just generate all the creations themselves?

Do you believe you, as a human, can predict the taste of the masses the way these corporations can? Social media companies are already capable of manipulating an entire generation of humans to sit infront of a screen and waste their entire lives away with meaningless drivel. What will they be capable of once they employ Machine Learning to learn from our consumptive choices about what kind of AI-generated content we will most prefer?

You as a flimsy human will not compete in that environment. The machines will not be a tool. You'll be a dimwitted ape in a world of Mega-AIs capable of sifting through the mega-feed of data that it produced, and using an evolutionary process to establish how to shape and satisfy it's consumers to the fullest degree possible. Even if the corporations give you the mercy of using their AIs, everything you do with those machines will be just another datapoint, used to train the next generation of machines.

How much huberis and arrogance do you have to presume that these AIs will not eventually have extracted all possible value you could provide? What if, despite your self-absorbed view of human superiority, it turns out that you are nothing more than an animal? 

&#x200B;

It will no longer be creativity for the people, by the people. In essence, it will be art for the machines, by the machines. All you will be is a conduit that serves to generate maximum profit, to oil the machines, until even that will be rendered obsolete.

&#x200B;

And this is only art. All of what I described will eventually apply to all human capacities. Science, journalism, medicine, philosophy. But of course, as fate has ordained, it all starts with the arts. Remove our humanity from the process in the pursuit of endless stimulation. More, faster. Who cares if it took a human to make it, as long as it's better? Who cares if their love was an integral part of the process, if the only goal is maximum pleasure?

Disconnect us from each other, from ourselves, then the rest will be a walk in the park. Those in power will not even require to enslave us with their machines. They will lull us into a deep slumber of endless stimulation so that we will willingly give over our humanity, embracing our fate instead of resisting it.

&#x200B;

In this world, the machines and the data fed to train them will be the only thing of value. The artists are just one step along the way, to be trampled and discarded, while pretending that now, all are given the capacity to create. In reality, mankind is selling it's soul to the machines, and by extention, those who control them.

&#x200B;

It really should have been obvious, should it not? First machine artists, then machine journalists. Then machine scientists, machine teachers, machine programmers, machine police-officers. Machine soldiers.

And then, there is no going back. Sitting at the switch will be the those who will determine the fate of this world, a world in which humans have been rendered useless and incapable.",44,48,1671575715.0

Nobody should take this post as a message to “erase or forget the past”.

But I fear far too much of lefty communities are pre-occupied with a nostalgic focus on the past. Not to learn and study these societies for practical application in todays work. No, just a focus on these societies (and usually their militaries) to help spark some sense of hope or purpose as a way to cope with todays world.

The Soviet Union is dead. Maoist China is dead.

We may pay our respects but it is time to make NEW movements and a NEW Socialist society. The tropes, symbols, leaders, slogans, and more from previous eras do not need to be erased but they do need to, more often then not, be respectfully laid to rest.

There is no reason to be carrying a Soviet flag at a protest today. There is no reason to be posting memes of Lenin, Stalin, or Mao as glorious chads or Red Army battle compilations almost constantly in some circles of the left. There is no reason that every communist flag needs to have the same tired iterations of the Hammer and Sickle as the main symbol.

We are in a new era. The material conditions and history have progressed. There are new movements, new organizations, and new symbols to adapt to. 

Pay homage to and learn from the past, but for all baby-leftists, do not let the ghosts of dead movements rule you.",103,37,1669486596.0

10fuzvc,socialism,Giving lectures about cultural difference and tolerance,StephMcWi,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/10fuzvc/giving_lectures_about_cultural_difference_and/,"I have a job where as part of it I give lectures about cross-cultural understanding. I would like some opinions from fellow socialists about what I should talk about it and how I should encourage people to think about their own cultures and others. I have very much overthought this, but I would appreciate to hear what you think of the assumptions and approach I am using.

In my reading, I have often come across texts concluding with things like ""there are no good or bad cultures"" and that people who are masters of cultural competency should be able to change their own values to seamlessly switch between different cultures.

I have a few problems with this. I think that there are ""good"" and ""bad"" aspects of all cultures and rather than just accepting that and leaving them as is, people should be encouraged to critique culture. I think that is it okay to critique cultures, including those of others, so long as you are consistant in how you are applying your values. People are agents in their societies and they have the right to change it if they disagree with it. The idea that culture is something that we should just accept or adapt ourselves to sounds like an extremely conservative worldview to me.

You should be able to critique cultures based on your values, but you must also always open to having your own values challenged. You would never completely agree with the culture that you grew up in and that is good. That means that you are thinking critically. You should always think about how the world could be made a better place.

Being critical of another culture is not the same as disrespecting it (again, so long as you are consistant). And, in saying that, you can still change your behaviour to behave in an appropriate way as a sign of respect for other people. Tolerance is key, and we must be intolerant of intolerance. Related to that, while I think that it is ok to disagree with another culture, you have no right to tell the people of that culture to change it. 

Any more thoughts? Any reading for me? Thank you!",5,2,1674110912.0

Xi Jinping's speech during the Centenary of the CPC, and these lines kinda caught my attention:**

""On the journey ahead, we must continue to uphold Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Theory of Three Represents, and the Scientific Outlook on Development, and fully implement the Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. We must continue to adapt the basic tenets of Marxism to China’s specific realities and its fine traditional culture. We will use Marxism to observe, understand, and steer the trends of our times, and continue to develop the Marxism of contemporary China and in the 21st century.""

""This means that we have brought about a historic resolution to the problem of absolute poverty in China, and we are now marching in confident strides toward the second centenary goal of building China into a great modern socialist country in all respects. ""

**Do you think Xi Jinping is genuine in his speech to uphold Marxist Principles?**

**Do you think the CPC under Xi Jinping will genuinely try to achieve their second centenary goal of building a ""Modern Socialist Nation""?**

I ask this because I've read somewhere that there has been an increase in encouraging Marxism and all thoughts aligned with it even Xi Jinping thought is being introduced to the school and Xi himself is encouraging Marxism in his speeches, unlike Hu Jintao who was the last leader.

""Cheers greeted China President Xi Jinping as he toured Beijing’s Renmin University of China in April, telling students and teachers: “We must continue to promote the modernization of Marxism.” Social science research, he said, should have “Chinese characteristics” and contribute to “China’s independent knowledge system.”

**I've also read articles that the CPC is actively cracking down on billionaires, and encouraging people to intensively study ""Socialism with Chinese Characteristics"", is this a genuine effort in taking the first steps in trying to chain the beast that are capitalists and capitalism? or is it just for politics/corruption?**

vm4eiy,socialism,Syndicalism: The needed balance between Democratic Input and Technical Expertise,ShimmyShane,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/vm4eiy/syndicalism_the_needed_balance_between_democratic/,"Whether you are an ML or a Libertarian Socialist, in order to achieve our shared goals of a functioning democratic society, we need concrete structures not just for our proposed government reforms but also for developing our own organizations as well. 

A key issue has always been what form should this structure take? With the recent explosion in interest in unions, and the young generation picking up the torch of radical unionization, it begs the question of how we can once again incorporate an increasingly unionized workforce into a coherent Socialist strategy. 

This also pairs with another key question that must be considered. How do we build a true and participatory democracy in a nation where the population has not just been made apathetic to democracy, but also kept dis-incentivized and inadequately educated in order to participate effectively in our world of increasingly complex decision making. 

I think the proposals of the Syndicalist movements that were the old foundation of the modern left must be re-examined. In a Syndicalist democracy the population would hold democratic power simultaneously within their workplace and government itself. Furthermore, beyond the day to day decision making, the population would have democratic input in larger societal policy and issues but with particular authority given to those within industries relevant to the question at hand. This provides in a sense the benefits of a democracy as well as the benefits of specialization and expertise in a world of complex decisions. It in a sense bridges the divide between a democracy and technocracy, and would engender a more pure and stable socialist government structure. 

I don’t think this should be an issue of one leftist school of thought vs another. Both anarchists (primarily anarcho-Syndicalists) and MLs can find shared ground and values within the concept of using unions as the bridge space between economic and civic democracy, and incorporate unionization into concrete policy proposals and organizing strategy.

In many cases, the study of [De Leonism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Leonism?wprov=sfti1) should be re-examined for these questions. Not to be merely copied dogmatically but adapted strategically.",19,7,1656359961.0
utctl4,socialism,Is social media fundamentally fixable?,HealthMotor8651,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/utctl4/is_social_media_fundamentally_fixable/,"I am going to ask this question in a couple different subreddits, both leftist, liberal, and tech oriented to hear as many responses as possible. If you see it there, that is why.

Social media is broken (yes I recognize the irony of asking this on reddit, one of the largest social media platforms in existence). I think this is something we can all agree on. Complaining, however, doesn't actually accomplish anything. What we should ask is this: how can we fix it?

I have spent a lot of time thinking about this and to be honest I really don't have an answer.

Here's the fundamental problem: all rules and regulations on social media are fundamentally unenforceable due to the sheer volume of content.

So, the whole point of social media is to connect people. Social media sites do this by linking together similar or related communities. So for example, if you're in a dog walking group you might also like to join a group dedicated to photos of dogs. Or if you're in a hearts or iron 4 group, you might want to join a Victoria II group that sorta thing. Social media does this for all interests and groups because that is the point. It is literally in the name, social networks. The point is to create networks. This would be true regardless of the economic system, socialist, capitalist, it doesn't matter because the whole point of social networks is to establish NETWORKS. The technology exists solely for that purpose. We can argue about incentives of different systems making this worse or not all the live long day, but at the end of the day the fundamental issue is the network effect.

This network effect can also lead to extremism. Right now, social media prioritizes high engagement content cause that keeps you on the network longer. But honestly, even if it didn't, just by connecting people it can still funnel people into extremism. The process would be slower and longer, but still would exist. I have personal experienced this. If not for social media, and the arguments and learning I have had here on reddit and on YouTube, I wouldn't be socialist today, I would be like a moderate liberal or right libertarian. Networking exposes you to new ideas. This has both positive and negative effects. 

So then, can't we just ban extreme content? How's that working out right now? The sheer volume of content put on social media makes it damn near impossible to filter, and even the filters in place today are attacked on limits to free speech or whatever (I'm sure that argument will be interesting in comments). But regardless of your stance on that, the practical effect is really difficult to moderate. Shit moves fast online, nazis and the like use code words and dog whistles that censors may not detect. You can ban accounts, but then they just pop back up under a different username. You can ban the ip, but they'll just use a VPN. You can require facial recognition to register, but how do you gurantee that they'll present their face to camera? That the person you're verifying is really the one using the account? That's not to even mention ever evolving bots and the like learning to get past filters. Or hell, most social networks originate in the anglophone world, how are you gonna police this stuff in Thai or Arabic? You're gonna need more bots and translators and the rest, and each of these can adapt at the same or greater speeds than the English world. See the issue?

Plus that's not even to get into the whole problem of predators and abusers using social media to stalk or manipulate their victims or other problems to constant comparison effecting mental health, cyber bullying, etc. And of course, should the extremists not like your content rules, they can always go form their own platform (Parler and Gab for example).

Social media, above all else, allows people to connect. This means both good and bad things. Those who we may not want to connect now can. Nut cases and conspiracy theories can now find adherents and those adherents can find each other and unite to try and combat their conspiracies, whether that be chemicals or fuckin QAnon. Nazis from around the country can find each other. Extremists of all stripes can now connect. And to be honest, I don't really see how to stop that short of getting rid of social media and I really don't think that is possible. So what's the solution here? As far as I can tell, there isn't really one. Regulation, abolishing private ownership of social media, or new social media cannot solve this fundamental problem because it is inherent to the technology itself.

Is there anything that can be done?",6,6,1652993688.0

Every individual has their own code of morality whether they belong to a religious or not. This is the same for societies and religions. When that code becomes dogma, when it does not allow for adaptation to better itself then that code becomes immoral. The entire premise that the constitution must be interpreted as the founding 'fathers' envisioned it is immoral. Fundamentalist by this definition are immoral and that is what the Catholic Church, the Evangelicals, the Federalists Society have become.

# GoldAndBlackRule's Guide to Tech Nomadding

This guide will attempt to answer many frequently asked questions about what it means and what it takes to live as a ""tech nomad"". It is primarily drawn on personal experience, but also informed by the experiences of many other ""expats"" I have befriended over the years.

This is not necessarily a ""how-to"" guide. Instead, it is better suited as a way to qualify whether someone *should* do it, and of the very few that should, *would* they do it? Of that small minority of those that *should* and *would*, it presents the obstacles of *can* those that should and would actually do it? Then *how* would they do it?

This guide will also discuss the rules on paper versus the realities of living the life. For privacy reasons, this guide is shared anonymously.

Nothing in this guide should be taken as legal or accounting advice. I am a tech guy, not a practicing lawyer or an accountant. Treat everything here with a healthy dose of skepticism and verify any claims made.

Lastly, I will be intentionally vague, because I cherish my anonymity and do not want this guide to be a doxxing map for those who are enraged by the very notion of someone leaving their home country and living the way that I do.

## What is a ""tech nomad""?

A tech nomad is someone who works primarily in information technology disciplines that do not require physical presence in a particular office or jurisdiction. They can perform their work remotely from anywhere with an Internet connection. Untethered from from requirements to be physically present, they choose to travel the planet, sourcing income remotely.

## Could You Be a Tech Nomad?

Practice self-qualification first. Is it even possible?

Well, as defined earlier, a tech nomad can do valuable work from anywhere there is Internet access. If this does not apply -- say, as a carpenter, a baker, or someone that must work locally, there is simply no way to do it. It is possible to get a *work visa* in another country to work in that country, but not just pick up and move every few months and travel while earning income.

**Is it Even Possible to Travel on a Passport or be Granted a Visa?**

There are many disqualifying factors here as well. Someone who has been convicted of a wide array of crimes may not qualify to get a passport from their own country. Even if they do, other countries that may be aware of criminal behaviour can deny visa and entry. This is a show-stopper. Without a passport and easy visa approval, being an international tech nomad doesn't easily happen.

**Are there Liabilities, Debts or Responsibilities that Might Present Serious Legal Challenges?**

Yes, certain legal issues can make it difficult to obtain a visa or passport from one's home country or from other countries. For example, civil disputes such as tort actions or family disputes can cause legal complications that may impede the issuance of a visa or passport. Other issues such as outstanding debts or criminal convictions can also impact one's ability to obtain the necessary documentation for international travel.

To mitigate these challenges, it is important to address any outstanding legal issues before attempting to travel abroad. This may involve resolving disputes or debts, seeking legal counsel, or working to clear one's criminal record. It is also recommended to research the visa and passport requirements for the countries one plans to visit and to disclose any relevant information honestly during the application process (if it is not visa on arrival).

* To reiterate the previous bullet-point: ***DO NOT BREAK THE LAW WHERE YOU VISIT AS A GUEST!*** This can put a rapid and unhappy end to travel as it jeopardizes the use of a passport and the issuance of visit visas.
* Open a foreign bank account. For *most* countries in the world, this is not (yet) a huge concern, though it is extremely helpful. It is a concern for citizens of USA, so it is a *must do first* action. It greatly simplifies accounting and compliance, reduces liabilities and, much like leaving all the stuff behind, is quite liberating in itself.
* Completely divest from the home country. No stocks, accounts, property or anything that could reasonably be caught up in bureaucracy or litigation should anchor the nomad.
* Form a company limited by shares in a country that does not tax dividends. Be honest with accounting

**Is the Interest in Being a Tech Nomad a ""Run-Away from Problems"" Strategy?**

This rarely works, as most problems follow people wherever they go. This is a horrible reason to relocate anywhere. That stuff needs to be faced and solved before someone can truly be free - not just from their problems, but from themselves - in a way that makes roaming the planet possible.

**Is it** ***Affordabl*****e to Travel the World as a Tech Nomad on Tech and IT Income?**

Most often, the answer is yes, but it may be more difficult for a fresh university graduate with limited experience to consistently land the kind of work that provides enough income to support a tech nomad lifestyle.

**Once Again, With Being in Hot Water with the Home Country: Are There Tax or Other Liabilities That Could Lead to a Passport Being Invalidated While Abroad?**

Evading the state can lead to government dropping the hammer and ensuring you get deported home to face whatever consequences it thinks are necessary to settle back home.

In short, there are a ton of internal and external factors that impede pursuit of a tech nomad lifestyle. Even if you *would* and *should*, the *could* factors shut it down until they are addressed.

## Should You Consider a Tech Nomad Life?

My own journey was accidental. I would absolutely make the same choices again, perhaps even earlier than I did. However, some expatriates, including tech nomads, regret the decision (the data is unclear and messy, it ranges from 13% to 67%). Based on personal anecdotes, many, within two years, are anxious to return to their countries of origin. The novelty of new culture, languages, food, taboos, laws and life wears off fairly quickly.

Of those who *can* become tech nomads, which is a minority of those who think they *want* to pursue the life, many tire of it within two years. The personal cost of making that choice in the first place come home to roost when they return to their country of origin. All of the ""stuff"" they gave away or sold because they could not take it is gone forever. It represents years of effort and nostalgia. If a spouse or children are in tow as well, they are victims of the decision too. Even if the tech nomad wants to see it through, immediate family might not. The break-up of that family takes a toll as well on everyone, including the die-hard tech nomad.

Of those who want to pursue life as a tech nomad (and bring their family along), many have a change of heart within 24 months. This is not something most people can predict about themselves or for their spouses or children.

There is a real, personal and familial impact on up-ending a stable and familiar life in exchange for adventure. The unintended negative consequences can be devastating for all involved.

Of those that *dream* of living the life, 99% *cannot* do it. That 1% that *can* do it, most probably *should not* do it, because life is very complex and messy.

Good advice to those thinking of expatriating forever and never being a resident in any society for the rest of their lives is to tell them not to bother. In almost every case, that advice is sound.

Most people *should not* pursue this kind of life.

## What are the Benefits?

For those that *can*, and *should* pursue it, there are vast benefits.

* Being a citizen of the whole wide world, or as Mark Twain said: ""Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one's lifetime."" This means having a more global perspective and understanding of different cultures, not necessarily holding citizenship in each country.
* Political considerations, such as escaping what one views as an authoritarian imposition on their lives. There is no guarantee any particular destination is any better, but being a nomad means sampling many societies and polities all over the world to see which improves a situation or which can make it worse.
* Financial considerations. A tech nomad, unless their home country engages in citizenship-based taxation, are not a tax residents if they spend less time than required for tax residency, which is typically six months. The tech nomad's income is mostly theirs to dispose of as they choose, apart from local tax obligations on sales or the proportion of rent dedicated to cover property taxes. Citizenship-based taxation is practiced by three countries: North Korea, Eritrea and USA -- it means you are subject to taxation even if you do not live or participate in the country where you are a citizen. No other countries do this. (See more about taxes later before knee-jerking at this paragraph).
* The lack of acquiring a lot of expensive and hard to move stuff is not a bug, it is a feature facilitating rapid mobility.

Tech nomads enjoy the freedom to live and work anywhere in the world without being weighed down by possessions or specific obligations.

## How is it Done?

This is a mystery to most people who have lived their entire lives in one place and have not lived abroad. What are the rules? What are the logistics? How is this even possible?

* First, the nomad must have a passport in hand. An extended page passport is going to be helpful, because what most governments issue will not last a few years. For example, USA issues a standard 28 page passport that is good for 10 years. A tech nomad will run through all of those pages in maybe 5 years, so getting a 52 page passport reduces the number of visits required to a US consular to request a replacement.
* The most important thing to remember: ***as someone roaming on visit visas, the tech nomad cannot earn money wherever they park their butts!*** All income must be sourced outside the country where they are visiting! Earning *any* money locally is a huge no-no that may jeopardize travel. Violating basic immigration rules like this can prevent visa grants elsewhere, even if the home country does not revoke the passport! Under no circumstances draw the *Eye of Sauron* that is a revenue and immigration authority your way for breaking the rules by trying some stupid local hustle!
* Take on personal contracts with any country except your home country or where you are visiting. Even if the contract is full of boilerplate verbiage about owing taxes, if you are not a resident there, it is really hard for a foreign government to tax a foreign contractor for simply providing services for a fee.
* Avoid, as much as possible, providing officially identifying documents such as the cover page for a passport or a tax ID number from the home country. This is never actually a requirement to doing business. Just a bill with bank routing information is enough.
* A tech nomad ***always observes immigration rules*** wherever they are guests. This advice cannot be repeated often enough.

## Don't be a dick!

The Tech nomad is a guest everywhere they go. Inciting citizens to complain to police about the nomad is a fast-track to losing visa status, ejection and even losing a passport. This means that tech nomads should always be mindful of their behavior and actions while in a foreign country, as any negative interactions with locals could result in serious consequences for their ability to continue traveling and working as a nomad. Even if the local culture seems bizarre to the nomad, they respect the customs and move on if it seems intolerable. Remember, tech nomads can move about freely to pick and choose where they visit -- locals cannot.

## OK, So What is it Really Like?

To provide a reality check, many countries that have immigration restrictions on the books will absolutely ignore those rules for the tech nomad. They typically do horrible things with their currency and are happy to have the nomad use whatever currency they are earning to be converted to local notes and dropped into the local economy. The rules say ""can't be here for more than 182 days"", but immigration agents will likely wave the tech nomad through without a second glance. The unwritten rule is that the local government wants that money directed to their economy and foreign fiat currency notes converted to local fiat currency notes. This is obviously counter to every immigration rule on the books, and it is frequently ignored.

## Maintain a ""Home Base"" Somewhere in the World. There Should be Someplace to Retreat to if Things in the World Get Weird, That is not the Nomad's Home Country.

This turned out to be an accidentally good move in light of the recent instabilities imposed by government pandemic protocols. I found a particular tropical island I liked that had gigabit fiber Internet service, was not as crowded as Singapore and was generally quite chill with very modern infrastructure. Through the course of my tech work, I needed some workstations to do a lot of heavy lifting compiling a massive codebase. A laptop on a beach in Thailand with decent WiFi wasn't going to cut it, and the country where this island is located was perfectly happy to turn a blind eye to me spending more time on it as long as I strictly complied with the visa run schedule and did not overstay a single visit.

Having a ""Home Base"" is a decent way to have some storage for the stuff a tech nomad needs to do the work. Yes, it is true that being able to pack a single carry-on bag and being ready to get up and go anywhere is crucial to executing the nomad strategy, but it is also crucial to be able to earn, and have a place to retreat to if things go sideways -- natural disaster where the nomad visits, political instability, or ... maybe ... a global pandemic.

During the Spring Festival in 2020 (Chinese New Year), rumors of another SARS outbreak were spreading rapidly. I figured it would just be another MERS/SARS travel inconvenience, which I did not want to get caught up in, so I headed to Home Base.

I *really* underestimated what was to come weeks later. The entire world locked down travel and severe restrictions were placed on populations everywhere. May expat friends were literally trapped in their hotel rooms abroad. Having a 4,000 sq ft, beachfront resort condo on a very high floor, low noise and with that gigabit fiber Internet placed me squarely in the newly discovered ""laptop class"" of remote workers. As a tech nomad, I was already living the remote work life for years and was well-equipped to adapt.

Home Base is also a convenient place to receive deliveries and mail that is of personal significance. The address listed through the company limited by shares can be a spam address. Maybe you ordered a new laptop or something and need to be physically present, for example.

## What About Taxes?

This is probably the most contentious topic when people discuss tech nomad life. Head to Internet forums, and users will animatedly and with great emotion shout ""you must pay income taxes ***somewhere***!!!""

Well, it is complicated. Apart from USA (tech nomads are never from North Korea or Eritrea), no other country engages in citizenship-based taxation. That means if you are not there for 183 days or more, your income (usually) cannot be taxed there. In other words, you must spend *most* of your time in that country for it to claim a right to tax your income.

However, many countries have agreed to Double Taxation Agreements, also known as *tax treaties* that are aimed to prevent a person from being taxed twice on the same income by different governments. The right to tax lies with the nation state where a person resides more than half of a year. Seems like a reasonable compromise to facilitate international trade and cooperation. However, it does not account for tech nomads, who rarely spend more than three months in a single country. Who gets to tax the income?

This is further complicated by *residency* rules. To be a tax resident under this (and most) regimes, again, one has to spend more than half of a year in the same jurisdiction. This does not apply to the tech nomad.

So, how does an EU firm and a tech nomad deal with this? Well, this is why *contract* work is key. Many tech companies will *outsource* some work for code, art, design, sysadmin, support and other functions. A contractor is not a full time employee where the EU firm resides. This serves as a contractual defense against the tax requirements that governments may attempt to impose. They cannot very well forbid a design firm in Paris from contracting an artist in Malaysia to produce some 3D models, or an IT worker in Bangalore from providing some ""follow the sun"" support for critical infrastructure.

So where does this leave the tech nomad? In a legal kind of limbo, where no single nation state can claim the right to tax her income. Unless the nomad is under a regime of *citizenship-based taxation*, it is a difficult knot to untangle.

Some firms in particularly strict nation states will demand proof of residency for open-ended contracts (e.g., pay the nomad €10,000 per month until the contract terminates). This is a situation where the nomad should push back or reject the contract. In my experience, this has happened only once, and fortunately, due to the pandemic, I could satisfy Double Taxation Agreement rules since I was allowed to extend my visa throughout the pandemic and show I was a present in one country for more than half a year.

Some firms may demand a TIN (Tax ID Number). On that account, it is up to the tech nomad to ask for the contract to be amended, which is often done, since there are hundreds of countries in the world with various degrees of bureaucratic failure for people who are not citizens or permanent residents. How the nomad chooses to satisfy contract requirements is a case-by-case issue, but it rarely comes up.

Lastly, as far as taxation goes, specifically for US citizens: ***do not mess with the IRS***. If the tech nomad ever hopes to visit USA again, hold any accounts in USA, have any property in USA, have any stocks with US brokers or anything else that can be leined or seized, compliance is crucial. The nomad will pay a tax, even if they actually owe no tax. They will pay a compliance tax to a specialist accountant to help prove they owe no tax. This will cost thousands each year. I refer to the advice earlier to ***completely divest*** so that property and assets are not targets for bureaucrats.

## Does This Mean the Tech Nomad is Forever Isolated?

Of course not. Quite the opposite. I make a fairly predictable visa circuit to the same neighborhoods on the same islands in the same countries and have long-lasting friendships established over a much broader population of diverse cultures than most people stuck in the corner of their own world in a small town can ever imagine. I don't just show up for a day and leave. I *live* in these places and form friendships. That I have to leave after three months before returning is the difference.

I met better half before going full tech nomad. We met while I was on a work pass in Europe via friends in the industry. Better half is a professional mortal enemy (production) to my career (technology), but we got along really well and eventually married. A happy accident is that better half is a citizen in one of the tropical nations on my circuit, so it was possible to apply for a spouse visa and long-term protection from the global immigration regime if needed. We still prefer to bounce around the world anyway and have been together for ten years now.",13,6,1681216691.0

I, like most in this sub, believe that a market based on supply and demand is superior to a political economy. However, because this process takes time, and because we have a limited amount of time to live, political decision-making processes will always be too tempting to ignore. 

What most think of market failure is either a market not supplying a good or service that can not be profitable, i.e., demand is too low to bother, or a market which production of higher order goods and it's transformation into lower order goods takes a longer length of time than the average time preference of the consumer. 

Demand for goods can accelerate faster than supply can adapt. If given enough time, supply will meet demand, but the time in between is an opportunity for political actors to seize control of production processes. We want stuff now rather than later and it seems to me that, unfortunately, we may never rid ourselves of political economy.",0,5,1677432967.0

Everywhere we look we see woke capitalist giant corporations advocating for a sixteen dollar minimum wage, encouraging  BLM riots  and trying to cancel culture conservatives and libertarians they don't like, and with hyper centralized web media platforms they can do it.

  In example Amazon wants a sixteen dollar minimum wage to kill small business, in 2020 all the big tech companies zealously endorsed the covid lock downs while small business owners lost all hope and BLM thugs ran rampant through the streets destroying private property while they made trillions. All the big tech companies want a world where everything digital is centralized and interdependent around them so they can control the flow of information and Govern us.  In a lawsuit against big tech, Donald Trump called big tech ""State Actors"" to describe how they always side with authoritarian left leaning policies and with their all powerful abilities censor and control the flow of information the generic public sees. Though I am not a Trump supporter I believe this is the case. Big tech and the public school system is the reason I think the culture is heading so far authoritarian left. The authoritarian left will always side with policies that lead to more centralization. Centralized health care, centralized currency with the Fed, and in my personal life centralized cloud based software with strong patent law to kill big techs competition. 

 America's left makes social inequality look like the biggest scariest boogie man and likens it to racism.  They also fail to distinguish between real threatening and violent forms of racism and non violent forms of racism (such as people shitposting on 4chan).  For the left ""racism is teh boogie man. ahhhh""   In my opinion I think racism is irrational and idiotic thinking and I am a fan of black economic thinkers like Thomas Sowell,  but it is not dangerous unless combined with centralization of power.  In example, Racism with centralization of power is Hitler or the Klan (circa 1920s). Racism without centralization of power is a shit poster on 4chan.

I also mentioned in inequality. Well contrary to what the left believes Inequality has nothing to do with racism.  In equality is part of freedom, and having Government (and corporate) central planners involved trying to prevent inequality will lead to a end game where we are all living equal in state funded housing pods. Tell that to your liberal college professor spewing left wing bullshit. To finalize my rant I believe the core problem is the left doesn't see danger in centralization. They embrace a world where Governments (and behind the scene large corporations) centrally control everything.  The mainstream left is helping the corruption they claim to want to stop and centralization of power is completely under their radar.

The truth is, if we  see the forest without the trees, the 2 are not as bad as we think.

Capitalism don't really cause wealth disparity because wealth disparity exist anyway without capitalism. Just look North Korea. Capitalism simply change the way those wealth disparity is achieved.

The same way, oppressions happen outside democracy anyway in general. As usual democracy change the way we oppress each other. Before, one Putin and one Kim Jong Un can oppress everyone else. Now, someone need to convince large number of people to agree to oppress you.

In a sense, Democracy change civil war to cultural war. And cultural war is less costly.

Hei, I would rather move to libertarian cities and use democracy to keep it libertarian than learning how to use artillery's.

Those who sacrifice a little freedom for money and comfort can end up having all of those. You don't see Bezos and Bill Gates joining army right? Be a good libertarian, and that means, be a good capitalist.

Besides, Democracy is often localized. Cities, States, and Villages have many autonomy. And this can be very useful for libertarian cause.

Most democratic countries have 2 rules when it comes to local democracy.

1. Open border. Nothing stop people from California to move to Texas. You can visit any country you want.
2. Population have voting power. So commies from California can go to Texas and vote higher taxes. If those commies have 40 children, each of which will eventually be able to vote too.
3. They basically allow autonomy to a local region but that local region must be democracy too.

Imagine you have a house. Anyone can come in and own the house. Also the one that stay and have more children will own more share of the house.

Democracy is like pro squater country.

So, it looks like having a libertarian city will be tough. The composition of people in any city will be roughly similar with composition of people in the country. If there are 50% of commies in the whole country then you'll probably have to have at least 25% commies in your city and that means the city won't be too libertarian.

If you own a house you simply keep squater out. But this solution is not available to cities. Besides you want autonomy right. So you want libertarian cities, not just libertarian apartments, or libertarian neighborhood.

So how would you do that?

Step 1: Concentrate among libertarians

Many projects are like this. Free state projects. And so on. If almost everyone in your city is a libertarian and you can maintain it that way, then your city will be very libertarian. That's how local election and regional autonomy works.

Step 2: Be a jerk to non libertarian

Okay, you can't stop people from coming to your city. But you can make sure they will avoid your city like plague. Arrange that your cities is as awesome as possible for libertarians but hell to everyone else.

Imagine if you're not making a libertarian city. Say you want a muslim city. How would you do it? You just use loudspeaker to sound Adzan call or whatever. Make it as super loud as possible. Non muslims will just get out.

Imagine if you're making a hip hop city. Get boom boxes play that all over the places. Normal people will get out.

What about Christian city? Prohibit sex outside marriage, prohibit abortion, prohibit polygamy, criminalize porn. Death penalty for drug users. I can assure you libertarians like me will run away and tremble in fear on mention of the city and Christianity in general.

But what can libertarians do?

Libertarians are ""nice"" right? What the fuck can we do?

Well....

Collectively own all public utilities. Private cops. Private court. Private road. Private fire department.

However adapt that collective utilities with democracy. Every voters (or resident) have a share. Anyone that want to live there should own a share and they can buy that from existing shareholders.

So basically, roads, cops, courts, fire departments, are owned collectively by a corporation and that corporation is owned equally by every voters.

I would suggest that the city itself is owned by a corporation. But I am looking for something less controversial.

The corporation itself can print more shares for extra income. That will come in handy when the city is successful and attract lots and lots of people

It's private property right? You can reject service to anyone right?

So, any visitors that want to live in your city and stay for significant amount of time have to do one or 2 things.

1. Own share of the corporation. The corporation only service shareholders mainly. Or......
2. Pay head taxes...

Think about it.

Imagine if instead of owning a city you own apartment. Newcomers will either buy an apartment and a share of the apartment building, or pay rent.

Same with your city. Newcomers will either pay head taxes or pay a share of your corporation.

It's your city. The city itself (or most of the public service) are private properties. If you want people living there paying head taxes it's your right.

What about those who can't afford it? Well, they're out. What happened to people that can't afford rent?

What happened to cradle to grave welfare recipients? Well, make a rule. Local democracy right. You can make rules here. Every children deserve residency, a share, voting right, and reasonable amount of food clothing etc. However, the one that have obligation to do so will be the biological parents.

Under no circumstances the corporation and the other resident in your cities be responsible for people that breed kids they cannot afford. It's local democracy. You rules. You decide. That will eliminate welfare by a lot.

If people can't afford? Yea they get out.

Basically you kept all economic parasites out of your cities.

Cities are even better than countries. I've heard countries can't banish bad citizen. Privately owned cities can.

The money the corporation collected can be used to alleviate suffering of those who have to pay income taxes. So you subsidize tax and tax subsidy. Make welfare taxable.

Okay that last one may not be a good idea. But resident dividend would be fine too.

It is toward your interests that every residents get as much welfare as possible from your national/federal government and pay as little tax as possible. It's a business. What do we expect?

Imagine if you have apartments. Say you collectively owned an apartment building or you are the landlord (king) of the apartment. You can add additional rules but you cannot remove national rules.

For example, if government criminalize Meth, you can say in my apartment you can't use alcohol too. However, apartment owners, in general, cannot decriminalize Meth. Any effort by apartment owners to make it easy for people to get Meth will cause problems. I've heard about civil forfeiture where your stuff can be seized by federal government just because some of your tenants use weed in places you rent.

An apartment owners can't. But city residents and city ""owners"" can. Besides, capturing a drug users require cooperation of DA and polices.

Arrange that the cops are private cops and pick libertarian DA that is answerable to the corporation. Make sure they don't press charge against non victimless crime.

Will this be fully libertarian? No. It'll be a step. In many places you will probably still have to pay federal income tax (or national income taxes). However, with no DA chasing you and every cops turn a blind eyes who cares. Just do most transaction with cash and crypto. Make it as difficult as fuck for national/federal cops to tax any of you.

Besides, cops need to live in your cities to capture criminals. Make sure head taxes for federal/national cops are very very very very very high.

Now, why do I say that each resident own one and only 1 share of the city/corporation that owned the city. That's because you may have to comply with democracy laws in your country. I suppose you can arrange that some guys can own bigger shares of the corporation. However, that wouldn't be democratic. Up to you.

By this time, I see one benefit of democracy of very distributed power. You don't want to forgo democracy and end up with a tyrant. So that one is optional.",0,9,1672678840.0

Below is a pic of my political ideology right now. I know that I am still authoritarian (mostly because I believe there must be a government to deal with this LGBT+ bullshit, fascist vegans, and Muslims who always ask me if I am a Christian and if I eat pork.

I know that I am not anarcho-capitalist but still, because of you guys, a guy like me who was closer to becoming a communist, went full right and I became a capitalist and I AM VERY PROUD OF IT.

Below is a short story of myself and how I was raised to be a socialist lover:

https://preview.redd.it/cxb1bfo0mt391.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f8d5ed5853b38ae67741914f03d34d0f5780e755

I was born and raised in Romania by my communist grandparents. They were a part of the Elite so communism worked like a wonder for them.

Why I was raised by them? My parents went to Madrid, Spain to work since I was 6. I didn't want to go there when I was 12 because I had adapted without them.

Even though Romania left communism behind, I thought that most of the people are still communists. I was dead wrong. I learned this with time when I came to Copenhagen, Denmark. At least my grandfather worked 12-16 hours per day, a combination of factory work + working his land by planting vegetables. My grandma was a housewife.

Durin 80-the 90s my grandfather was the only one who worked. With 2 sons, himself and my grandma, he managed to feet the entire family but he was the leader of the worker's union in my hometown so yeah, he was at least top 10% in the country and of course a communist party member.

In the 90s after Romania became free and Capitalist, my father was given a trip to LA, one of the few to get sent during those time. He worked for Borla. The Americans wanted to see him because he was a diplomat and a great worker/manager.

When my grandfather saw America, he realized that communism was a stupid dream. Even though he was a part of the elite, after the collapse of communism, he lost political power, wealth, and status but he always worked as much as he could(like a true capitalist).

When he learned about Microsoft, he knew that he must teach me (I was 2-3 years old) how to use the computer. He knew those computers and that Americans knew how to make a country efficient and great. 8 years forward, he worked 12 hours shifts for an Italian and managed to buy me a Pentium 4.

Because of him, I managed to learn about computers from a young age and after I was 16, I was fixing computers for money. I was better than most computer shops in my town (for every problem you have, they reinstalled a pirated version of Windows XP).

Now the real problem with Socialists/Communists is that they never work. I came to Demark and I was shocked by how communistic everything felt. Present-day Romania is very capitalistic and the society is very competitive.

Imagine there are many Danish 25-35 years old living in communes. No one works or gets paid to study by the government something they never use because they expect the government to give them everything. I was so shocked.

My grandfather, a communist loyalist worked 16 hours per day in his 50s-60s and these fuckers complain about a 37 hours per week job (majority of Danes work like this).

They are so oppressive and closed-minded. They hate me because I eat kebab/shawarma. Why? Animals suffer because I demand meat. The women don't shave their bodies. Some of them have huge bushes under their armpits and some LGBT feminists dye them pink or any other color.

They told me that a woman must be loved no matter how hairy or ugly is without makeup. I am 25 so people around me are 20-25 years old. Danish guys are shaved all over their bodies, and they do their fingernails and toenails while the girls do not.

Why do the girls in my home country work to look better, 8-12 hours per day shifts to have a better life, and these danish girls look at me like a criminal because I take their jobs(that they don't even want to work anyway) and because I am not a vegan.

They are like fascists and the government even though they say and paid for my education, they don't give me a chance to work because I don't speak danish like a dancer and of course like a native. Even if I learn danish, I would speak like a Romania which is a huge no but they are ok with Muslims breaking the law and pushing their agendas in this country.

I am 25 years old now and every day I see why socialism is a failure, and how in the long term it breeds lazy fucks that blame hard-working people for all the atrocities they create anyway.

I might become one day an anarcho-capitalist but I must suffer more in this country that is more communist than Romania ever was.

I want to thank you all because every day I read posts in this subreddit. Because of you guys, I finally became a capitalist. I managed to get one of my friends from being a socialist like me, to become a capitalist.

Now we invest in the stock market and cryptos to create a better world(even for these fat commie fucks).

Thanks for making me see the world clearly. I will not disappoint you.",186,157,1654443254.0
yufqd6,Anarcho_Capitalism,My history of prediction and analysis,JimAtEOI,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/yufqd6/my_history_of_prediction_and_analysis/,"**Purpose**

The purpose of this article is to make the case for why anyone should take [my analyses and predictions](https://leagueofrealpeople.com/my-history-of-prediction-and-analysis/) seriously. I have three motives: 1) I plan to make a particularly important prediction and analysis in the near future, and it will then be necessary to cite my record thus far. 2) If a critical mass takes my predictions and analyses seriously enough, that will move us closer to the world we all want, which indirectly helps me, my offspring, my species, and all sentient life. 3) If a critical mass takes my predictions and analyses seriously enough, then that may force the [Apex Players](https://endofinnocence.com/they-live-cabal-nwo-conspiracy/) to abandon (or at least postpone) their plans.

After we look at some things I have gotten right, we will look at some things I have gotten wrong, because what I got wrong reveals how I adapted and why I have been getting so many things right in the last few years. We will also talk about my techniques.

It would be impossible to compile everything I have gotten right across all forums over the last 40 years, but I will make a start.

**Things I got right**

When I was a teenager, I wrote a letter to the Secretary of Defense explaining how easily the USSR could defeat their imminent deployment of 100 MX ICBMs in a configuration they called “Dense Pack”. Before that, I was hearing about it on the news every night for months, and it was promoted in every journal I read, such as “Aviation Week and Space Technology”. Three weeks after I sent my letter, I never heard another mention of dense pack. [That was the first time I saved us all.](https://endofinnocence.com/the-first-time-i-saved-us-all/)

Also throughout my teenage years, I went to a magnet school for kids whose parents cared about them the most, and who were thus above average, and yet: 1) I won an essay contest against all 1300 other kids about why America was exceptional. 2) My guidance counselor told me that I got the highest SAT score out of the 300 students in my class. 3) I snuck into the room that had everyone’s report cards and verified that my grades were higher than everyone else in my class.

As a teenager I was also: 1) designing jet fighters, strategic bombers, anti-ballistic missiles, and satellite launch systems. 2) Mapping the shape of the universe. 3) Tracking the production rates and capabilities of Warsaw Pact weapons systems vs. NATO. 3) Designing  global governments. 4) Developing strategies to defeat the USSR, such as by finding the optimum points from which to launch nuclear cruise missiles if necessary. That was all just for fun. It was nothing serious or in collaboration with others.

These are not just early examples of my abilities, but they also help to explain why I have such high confidence in my abilities, which I also thought was a large source of my motivation, but I later realized that my motivation comes from deep within and is inexhaustible. (I can’t explain it.)

A few years later, in 1990, I was thinking about the future, and I foresaw two products that I had never heard mentioned before—not even as primitive prototypes. One was smart phones and the other was digital cameras—just like what we have today. My friends just thought it was amusing, but one later admitted that I had totally nailed it back then.

Also in the 90’s ….

I have been saying since the mid 90’s that freedom would keep going down, and it has …. and that prices, taxes, laws, regulations, government spending, and political correctness would keep going up; and they have.

It was probably 1995 when I tried to figure out if it were possible for the free-market to do everything we needed and do it better than government. After about six months, I had it figured out. One of my more recent explanations is called [Rule of Market](https://endofinnocence.com/rule-of-market-anarchy-capitalism-future/).

I have never invested much time into YouTube, Facebook, or Twitter, because I have said since about 1999 that once such platforms are big enough, they will use that power to pull the rug out from under independent thinkers who depend on them, which they have been doing for a few years now.

In February 2011, I predicted that the prophecy (e.g. building the third temple) will be used to manipulate Christians and non-Christians, which is potentially billions of people. [My earliest writing that I have found about it is from November 3rd, 2013.](https://endofinnocence.com/jesus-confronts-american-believer/) Among the recent confirmations are: 1) [Rabbis are claiming that the messiah is here.](http://leagueofrealpeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Prophecy-The-Messiah-is-here-Yanuka-Rav-Shlomo-Yehuda-ben-David.png) an 2) [The prerequisite of finding a perfect red heifer has been accomplished.](http://leagueofrealpeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Prophecy-perfect-red-heifer-flown-to-Israel-from-Texas.png)

Throughout 2011, I was explaining to progressives in Seattle that Obama voters were getting really frustrated, and that they were desperate for Obama to give them their orders, but they all insisted that Obama voters thought no such thing. Then, in November 2011, [Chris Matthews, who was probably Obama’s biggest fan in the media, cried out in frustration](https://endofinnocence.com/give-us-our-orders/) on his national TV show, “Obama! Give us our orders!”

[On December 16, 2012, I said that Matt Damon is being used to condition us on how they want us to behave, and who they want us to trust, during a global pandemic.](https://endofinnocence.com/what-i-learned-from-matt-damon/)

I said on June 10, 2013, that those at the top can start a pandemic anytime they want, and they did. I had been saying that for a few years before then, but I found [an article from 2013](https://endofinnocence.com/prism-whistleblower-busts-nsa-and-obama/) where I said the following:

I said before the 2016 election that Hillary Clinton, who was the Secretary of State for the Obama/Biden administration, and who was the front runner for President in that election; would be much more likely than Trump to start WWIII and that it would be with Russia, and then we saw how she and her allies in the media blamed Russia for everything for years after that. In 2022, we saw Biden trying pretty hard to start WWIII with Russia, such as by having the proxy regime in Ukraine fire artillery on Ukrainian citizens who live near the Russian border, and who identify more as Russians, all in an effort to provoke Russia to intervene to protect them. Then he blew up the two natural gas pipelines by which Russia supplied Europe with natural gas. I know he was the  perpetrator for several reasons: 1) [The US has admitted to provoking wars in the past and planning to provoke wars in the future](http://leagueofrealpeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/WINEP-Patrick-Clawson-2012-09-24-how-to-provoke-war-with-Iran.mp4), 2) by the end of that same day in which Biden blew up the pipelines, I had already found [a video from February 7, 2022](http://leagueofrealpeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Ukraine-20220207-Biden-threatens-to-destroy-the-Nordstream-2-pipeline-if-Russia-invades-Ukraine.mp4), in which Biden confessed his intent to put an end to the (already existing) pipelines if Russia intervened, and 3) After he blew up the pipelines, his allies at home and abroad applauded the act. As of this writing (11/12/22), the result of such reckless war crimes is that [4 out of 8 commands are at DEFCON 2, and the other 4 are at DEFCON 3](https://www.defconlevel.com/).

[I said on February 28, 2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/fb30ws/ceos_know_something_alarming_and_imminent/) that [the spike in CEO departures meant that something big was coming](http://leagueofrealpeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/CEO-Departures-By-Month.png) that would impact CEOs in a big and negative way, and which would thus probably impact us too.

If I would not be all that surprised, that means I would be surprised, but that I would not be extraordinarily surprised. In even more concrete terms: I expected one of those thing to happen in the next 12 months, and I expected the others to move closer to reality in the next 12 months, and that is exactly what happened, and as of this writing, they continue to move closer to reality.

My article on September 4th, 2020, about [the Rittenhouse/Kenosha incident](https://leagueofrealpeople.com/kenosha-kyle-rittenhouse-rosenbaum/)  has proven to be correct from the beginning, in spite of a massive  disinformation campaign by the entire establishment. Although it was one  of thousands of things I have been right about, unlike most, a large  portion of the mainstream was allowed to learn that my position was  correct in this case.

When the US suddenly got out of Afghanistan, I said that the motive  may be that the US was planning to use those troops for their next war.  Then when the Western establishment suddenly backed off from Covid, I  said that their next big op, probably in Ukraine, must be imminent.

Before social distancing, I had said the Apex Players were trying to make us dislike, distrust, and **distance** each other, so that we are looking at each other instead of looking at them, and so that we cannot unite against them.

**How I do it**

Some techniques and perspectives that help me to make such predictions and analyses:

* I consider the source. Some examples: 1) Does the source have a conflict of interest? 2) Have I previously caught the source in a lie? 3) Who are the allies/opponents of the source?
* I frequently evaluate a wide variety of sources.
* I frequently solicit feedback from a wide variety of people.
* I consider how compatible new information is with what I have already vetted.
* I developed a rule long ago from observing my pets: “When something is out of the ordinary, investigate.”
* I trust my own ability to think.
* I try to go wherever the facts take me.
* I try to unload any personal baggage.
* I consider no question off limits.
* I see all that exists as clay—as just more raw materials for building the future.
* I am comfortable with uncertainty. Certainty is just an emotion. Almost nothing is 0% or 100%. Almost everything is somewhere in between.
* I use my subconscious. For example, if I am stuck, I say to myself, “It is almost as if ….”, and my subconscious will often provide the thought that my conscious mind had placed off limits.
* I frequently test my understanding, such as by making predictions. These are mostly little predictions, such as predicting the order in which respondents will choose each answer in a poll that I developed.
* I frequently test my own biases with the mirror test.
* I am willing to not have any friends if that is the result of pursuing truth.
* I am continually adjusting my current understanding based on new information.

One of the reasons my understanding is so mature is that the new information I incorporate includes corrective feedback. Incorporating corrective feedback has not only directly improved my abilities, but it has revealed a trend in my errors.

**The Trend**

Let me first give an example.

Although I correctly understood in 2011 that Obama’s followers were desperate for him to give them their orders, and although I was correct in spite of rabid denial by every Obama follower I asked, I was wrong about there being a 30% chance of a third term for Obama, which I think I first predicted in 2009, which was the first year of his first term, and which was also extraordinarily unconstitutional in a direct manner that the average person could see, and thus no one else was predicting  it yet.

I was correct that sufficient power, and sufficient desire existed. I was also right that Obama was the first President in our lifetime who had so much potential to command armies of civilians, so I was sure they would use that power if they could. My thinking was, “Why else would they have created the Myth of Obama in the first place?”

However, I did not understand that Obama was just a test run of his masters’ ability to create an Obama. I did not understand how easily they could create another Obama. I did not understand that they would still be around to create another Obama because they were not just the left. I did not understand the extent to which both parties worked for the same people. I did not understand that their masters were globally dominant and not just controlling America. Therefore, I did not understand that giving Obama a third term would have pierced the [illusion of legitimacy](https://endofinnocence.com/beyond-piercing-illusion-legitimacy-social-contract-psyop-zero-squad/), which out which, they are finished. Americans—the word—would have seen that the system didn’t work, that it didn’t work like they thought it did, and that government didn’t work for the people.

That is my favorite example of how the trend in my errors is that I keep underestimating the degree of conspiracy.

I am thinking that I may be starting to bump up against the correct level of conspiracy, because sometimes I am a little surprised at how much leash the Apex Players give their front men. Then again. Maybe I am still underestimating the level of conspiracy. Maybe their power is so great now that they can afford to give their front men a longer leash. For example, their ability to control the narrative is unprecedented.

**The Web**

One might assume that if I am so good at analysis and prediction, then I should have been able to make more predictions, and with greater accuracy, and that I should be rich. However, I have no inside  information, and even if I did have inside information, detailed prediction would still be very difficult. Even the Apex Players themselves would have trouble predicting details because they have  constructed a world that is a mutually reinforcing web. Therefore, many alternative paths further their agenda, which let’s them not only choose from multiple plays for each of their many thousands of plays, but it lets them easily switch from plan A, to plan B, to plan C, if necessary, for each play.",2,5,1668376594.0

He then specifically lamented that the number of farms in his state of Vermont had decreased from over 8,000 in 1960 down to 2,200 by 1993. Aside from mentioning how young people there ostensibly did not want to follow in their dairy farmers footprints because of low milk prices, he doesn’t give any evidence showing this to be the result of agribusiness, but he all the same suggests that it is those dastardly more efficient farms offering a lower price to the consumers that accounts for his state’s decrease in their number of farms. He claims this story to be the same across the nation and makes the dubious claim that relying on agribusiness and “foreign nations” (as though their governments had nationalized food production and there were no foreign agribusinesses) means that America’s food security is at risk. He cynically invokes the rhetoric of decentralization to argue that relying on family farms who would charge higher prices would be better for Americans than relying on larger entities who charge lower prices. Without a hint of irony, he then argues for the federal government to adapt the centralizing policy of supply management through his proposed Milk Supply Management and Nutrition Assistance Act of 1993. For context, supply management was (and unfortunately, still is) a federal Canadian policy that artificially raises the prices of Canadian milk, eggs, and poultry and keeps out foreign competition in order to help that country’s farmers at the expense of their consumers. Thankfully, this legislation was not one of the three bills that Bernie Sanders managed to get passed in Congress during his productive career as a politician. But aside from it being an ironic scene that this man who now blames inflation on “corporate greed” was actively advocating for the price of milk and products containing it to be artificially increased by an unabashedly corporatist-sounding “National Milk Marketing Board”, this clip is much more important for showcasing economic fallacies that our elected officials alarmingly showed and still show decades or even centuries after the world’s great economists had tried to put to rest. In this case, it would be Frederic Bastiat’s Broken Window Fallacy that he articulated in his famous 1850 article “That Which We See and That Which We Do Not See” and which Henry Hazlitt further elaborated on his classic 1946 book *Economics in One Lesson*.

This proposed H.R. 3770 of the 103rd Congress legislation revealed much about the importance of looking beyond the immediately seen effects of an economic policy on one group of people to see what the impacts it would have on everybody will be. To be specific, much as it would behoove a voter to know that throwing a rock through a window and creating jobs for a glazier would not make a society any richer because of the deferred spending and wealth that could have been created by that window owner should they not now have to pay for window repair and could have instead used that money for something else, so too would it be of use for them to know that having federal bureaucrats at this National Milk Marketing Board set an arbitrary price floor on what dairy farmers must be paid might be good for the farmers, it would make everybody else poorer by raising the price of milk and all the products they buy that contains milk. Subsequently, society would be no richer, as products that might have been purchased or investments made had milk remained cheaper would now no longer occur. It would just be more visibly seen that family farms were no longer struggling due to agribusinesses charging lower prices and it would not be nearly as seen that people’s wallets were hurting due to the sudden dairy price hike. If recent events are any indicator, the extent that such negative effects were seen, they would doubtless be blamed only on the greed of the remaining agribusinesses, which would doubtless have still existed and perhaps even flourished, in spite of their smaller competitors also getting this proposed corporate welfare.

You might be thinking that this was ultimately just the crazy wishes of some socialist politician and that this is no longer relevant, but sadly, this is not the case. Putting aside the fact that Sanders still has not grasped economics and thus still thinks that Canada’s supply management policy is a good idea, as shown by it being included in the platforms of both his 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns, the reality is that America had far from a free market in agriculture before this legislation was proposed in 1993 and it still does not all these decades later. Indeed, the specific legislation that Sanders introduced would have amended the 1949 Agricultural Act and just adding a further layer of corporate welfare to this Truman administration legislation that was designed to “stabilize” agricultural prices. Ever since the New Deal, it has been the norm for the federal government to intervene directly in agriculture in order to keep prices artificially higher for the producers, regardless of what happens to everyone else’s bank account. In today’s Congress, it is definitely not just Bernie Sanders who supports corporate welfare for farmers. Even such ostensible free market supporting Republicans, such as Senator Marco Rubio, will throw that principle to the wayside when the topic of farming sugar or some other crop in their respective districts, comes up. All of this invariably comes back to the Broken Window Fallacy of seeing the higher prices for some of their constituents and ignoring the consequences of this policy to everybody else and to the economy as a whole. As shown by supply management being a specifically Canadian idea, this idea extends far beyond America’s borders. Only in New Zealand, in no small part due to Finance Minister Roger Douglas in the 1980s, have they fully appreciated what Bastiat wrote nearly two centuries ago by ending all agricultural subsidies. We can only pray that the rest of the world follows suit.

I think the design is related to this subreddit, and you could do research on blockchains for yourself.

There is a lot of stigma around cryptos, partly because of the disproportional negative media coverage (almost never coverage on legit businesses using them), and partly because there are a lot of scams where many lose money.

However, compared to current monetary systems, cryptos are not fundamentally different, they are an information system, just like any fiat systems. Before I introduce you on the design of this crypto (Lumin), I will first list the two main designs of the current monetary systems:

1. the fiat systems: the systems are adaptable, they could raise interest rates to reduce inflation, or reduce rates to stimulate consumption and production. However, they are always controlled by some small group of people, who could print money almost without any decent public scrutiny.
2. the old cryptos: designed to always be deflationary in the long term, (BTC, ETH, Doge, MXR etc), always with pre-programmed staking/mining etc rewards, regardless of market situations. In a sense, they are fairer, but their monetary design could potentially be very bad for economies by inhibiting consumption, and would not be good for its own transaction usage. (Gresham's law)

The design of our crypto is to combine the best of two systems. It will allow monetary policies, so the system could be as adaptable and economically compatible as the centralized systems (ex. raise rates during inflation). However, all monetary changes will be done on the blockchains, through direct democracy.

Anyone could propose, vote on, and execute the policies on the blockchain, and there are zero admins or other special entities. In a sense, it is community banking in lieu of central banking, and thus would be much more transparent, democratic, and decentralized than the current adaptable systems.

The voting weights depend on the amount of it held. However, in the future, the community could vote to partially or fully switch to some one-person-one-vote system. Such systems (proof of humanity) are not mature at the moment, but it could be in the future.

I think such a cryptocurrency could be related to this sub (actually, more related to libertarianism), and I think it could develop to be an ideal currency (better than both the older centralized systems and the older cryptos) for the future monetary world.",3,3,1658196483.0

#What Libertarians Should Learn From the Abolitionists


Murray N. Rothbard

[A Selection from Libertarian Review, August 1978.]

If victory is indeed our given end, an end given to us by the requirements of justice, then we must strive to achieve that end as rapidly as we can.

But this means that libertarians must not adopt gradualism as part of their goal; they must wish to achieve liberty as early and as rapidly as possible. Otherwise, they would be ratifying the continuation of injustice. They must be “abolitionists.”

The objection is often raised that abolitionism is “unrealistic,” that liberty (or any other radical social goal) can be achieved only gradually. Whether or not this is true (and the existence of radical upheavals demonstrates that such is not always the case), this common charge gravely confuses the realm of principle with the realm of strategy ...

The “realism” of the goal can only be challenged by a critique of the goal itself, not in the problem of how to attain it. Then, after we have decided on the goal, we face the entirely separate strategic question of how to attain that goal as rapidly as possible, how to build a movement to attain it, etc.

Thus, William Lloyd Garrison was not being “unrealistic” when, in the 1830s, he raised the glorious standard of immediate emancipation of the slaves. His goal was the proper one, and his strategic realism came in the fact that he did not expect his goal to be quickly reached. Or, as Garrison himself distinguished,

Urge immediate abolition as earnestly as we may, it will, alas! be gradual abolition in the end. We have never said that slavery would be overthrown by a single blow; that it ought to be, we shall always contend. (The Liberator, August 13, 1831)

From a strictly strategic point of view, it is also true that if the adherents of the “pure” goal do not state that goal and hold it aloft, no one will do so, and the goal therefore will never be attained. Furthermore, since most people and most politicians will hold to the “middle” of whatever “road” may be offered them, the “extremist,” by constantly raising the ante, and by holding the pure or “extreme” goal aloft, will move the extremes further over, and will therefore pull the “middle” further over in his extreme direction. Hence, raising the ante by pulling the middle further in his direction will, in the ordinary pulling and hauling of the political process, accomplish more for that goal, even in the day-by-day short run, than any opportunistic surrender of the ultimate principle.

In her brilliant study of the strategy and tactics of the Garrison wing of the abolitionist movement, Aileen Kraditor writes,

It follows, from the abolitionist’s conception of his role in society, that the goal for which he agitated was not likely to be immediately realizable. Its realization must follow conversion of an enormous number of people, and the struggle must take place in the face of the hostility that inevitably met the agitator for an unpopular cause. ... The abolitionists knew as well as their later scholarly critics that immediate and unconditional emancipation could not occur for a long time. But unlike those critics they were sure it would never come unless it were agitated for during the long period in which it was impracticable. ...

To have dropped the demand for immediate emancipation because it was unrealizable at the time would have been to alter the nature of the change for which the abolitionists were agitating. That is, even those who would have gladly accepted gradual and conditional emancipation had to agitate for immediate and unconditional abolition of slavery because that demand was required by their goal of demonstrating to white Americans that Negroes were their brothers. Once the nation had been converted on that point, conditions and plans might have been made. ...

Their refusal to water down their “visionary” slogan was, in their eyes, eminently practical, much more so than the course of the antislavery senators and congressmen who often wrote letters to abolitionist leaders justifying their adaptation of antislavery demands to what was attainable. ...

If the primary and overriding goal of the libertarian movement must be the victory of liberty as rapidly as possible, then the primary task of that movement must be to employ the most efficacious means to arrive at that goal.

To be efficacious, to achieve the goal of liberty as quickly as possible, it should be clear that the means must not contradict the ends. For if they do, the ends are being obstructed instead of pursued as efficiently as possible. For the libertarian, this means two things:

that he must never deny or fail to uphold the ultimate goal of libertarian victory; and

that he must never use or advocate the use of unlibertarian means — of aggression against the persons or just property of others.

Thus, the libertarian must never, for the sake of alleged expediency, deny or conceal his ultimate objective of complete liberty; and he must never aggress against others in the search for a world of nonaggression. For example, the Bolsheviks, before the revolution, financed themselves partially by armed robbery in the name of “expropriating” capitalists; clearly, any use of aggression against private property in order to finance the libertarian movement, in addition to being immoral by libertarian principles, would cut against those principles themselves and their ultimate attainment.

At this point, any radical movement for social change, including the libertarian movement, has to face an important, realistic problem: in the real world, the goal — for the libertarian, the disappearance of the state and its aggressive coercion — unfortunately cannot be achieved overnight. Since that is the case, what should be the position of the libertarian toward “transition demands”; i.e., toward demands that would move toward liberty without yet reaching the ultimate goal? Wouldn’t such demands undercut the ultimate goal of total liberty itself?

In our view, the proper solution to this problem is a “centrist” or “movement-building” solution: namely, that it is legitimate and proper to advocate transition demands as way stations along the road to victory, provided that the ultimate goal of victory is always kept in mind and held aloft. In this way, the ultimate goal is clear and not lost sight of, and the pressure is kept on so that transitional or partial victories will feed on themselves rather than appease or weaken the ultimate drive of the movement.

Thus, suppose that the libertarian movement adopts, as a transitional demand, an across-the-board 50 percent cut in taxation. This must be done in such a way as not to imply that a 51 percent cut would somehow be immoral or improper. In that way, the 50 percent cut would simply be an initial demand rather than an ultimate goal in itself, which would only undercut the libertarian goal of total abolition of taxation.

Similarly, if libertarians should ever call for reducing or abolishing taxes in some particular area, that call must never be accompanied by advocating the increase of taxation in some other area. Thus, we might well conclude that the most tyrannical and destructive tax in the modern world is the income tax, and therefore that first priority should be given to abolishing that form of tax. But the call for drastic reduction or abolition of the income tax must never be coupled with advocating a higher tax in some other area (e.g., a sales tax), for that indeed would be employing a means contradictory to the ultimate goal of tax abolition. Libertarians must, in short, hack away at the state wherever and whenever they can, rolling back or eliminating state activity in whatever area possible.

As an example, during every recession, Keynesian liberals generally advocate an income tax cut to stimulate consumer demand. Conservatives, on the other hand, generally oppose such a tax cut as leading to higher government deficits. The libertarian, in contrast, should always and everywhere support a tax cut as a reduction in state robbery. Then, when the budget is discussed, the libertarian should also support a reduction in government expenditures to eliminate a deficit. The point is that the state must be opposed and whittled down in every respect and at every point: in cutting taxes or in cutting government expenditures. To advocate raising taxes or to oppose cutting them in order to balance the budget is to oppose and undercut the libertarian goal.

But while the ultimate goal of total liberty must always be upheld and the state must be whittled down at every point, it is still proper, legitimate, and necessary for a libertarian movement to adopt priorities, to agitate against the state most particularly in those areas that are most important at any given time. Thus, while the libertarian opposes both income and sales taxes, it is both morally proper and strategically important to select, say, the income tax as the more destructive of the two and to agitate more against that particular tax. In short, the libertarian movement, like everyone else, faces a scarcity of its own time, energy, and funds, and it must allocate these scarce resources to their most important uses at any given time. Which particular issues should receive priority depends on the specific conditions of time and place.",2,1,1651702634.0

ut3aj7,democracy,Why Godot bans Ukraine - Godot's sponsors are Russian companies,Xrayez,https://www.reddit.com/r/democracy/comments/ut3aj7/why_godot_bans_ukraine_godots_sponsors_are/,"Hello! I'm from Ukraine!

I'd like to share a story with you. Even though this topic may seem slightly off-topic (it revolves around game development), I decided to share it with you, because this touches core parts of democracy values.

Note that my post is not an expression of resentment as it may seem at first. As a citizen, it's my ethical duty to bring this up.

By the way, for US citizens, this topic is relevant. Godot is governed by Software Freedom Conservancy on financial level, which is based in US.

**TL;DR**: Godot leadership is trying hard to convince people that it's a community-driven project, but it's not. Godot leadership and their followers despise freedom of speech. Godot as an organization receives money from Russian sponsors. Godot permanently bans an Ukrainian co-author for saying the truth.

# What is Godot?

Godot is a not-for-profit, open-source game engine in the IT industry. I've been contributing to its development for the past 5 years and even become a member of Godot organization at some point.

Godot as an **community-driven** project describes one very important principle: **open discussion**. I also assume that those principles would also imply the right to **freedom of speech**, and everything seems to be fine. But to my disappointment, what I've faced terrified me, and hopefully I'll be able convey the true nature of what's happening, and I'm going to tell you this next.

So, you may ask: ""What the problem exactly""? I have no right to object if a particular organization or project has some specific set of rules that you must abide to. But the problem starts to appear when someone gets to delude people. Imagine when you buy a box with chocolate candies, but when you go home and open it, you discover that there are no chocolate candies there in the first place!

**Open-source model**

The development of most healthy (that is, ""with chocolate"", so-to-speak) open-source projects out there go through what we call *consensus*. But Godot's development is driven by *compromises* instead. Godot tells that decisions are based on pure *meritocracy*, but it's actually based on *trustocracy*.

These contradictions (words vs actions) lead to quite unexpected reactions and consequences for contributors that attempt to reveal them in Godot. These contradictions include topics such as:

* *Decisions*: past vs present.
* *Development philosophy*: does it exist or not? Spoiler: no, it doesn't! Why?!
* *Governance model*: is it democracy, meritocracy, do-ocracy, trustocracy, ~~slaveocracy~~?

When someone is ignoring or refusing to acknowledge that contradictions do exist despite facts that are presented, this is called *hypocritical behavior*.

In the case of Godot, those discussions will be ignored or blocked, because, according to Godot leadership, these type of discussions ""hurt Godot's image"". For instance, the following activities are discouraged or forbidden:

* Cross-referencing and quoting in Godot communities.
* Making comparisons of Godot to other technologies.
* Clarifying Godot's governance model itself.

Due to this, Godot leadership takes passive-aggressive position which manifests itself in manipulative behavior such as:

* *Cyberbullying*: ""You cannot do that. If you do this, you will be banned.""
* *Accusations*: ""You're a trouble-making person, so we're tired to reason with you.""
* *Gaslighting*: ""We have thousand contributors, but you're the only one who does this.""

So, without further ado, let's switch to concrete series of events.

# Russian invasion of Ukraine

The war allowed me to see everything crystal clear. The war breaks illusions.

On 24 February 2022 at approximately 4:30 AM, I've heard really loud explosions. Later in the morning, I turned on my PC and I saw the news. I contacted my friends online. I also entered the Godot chat and said:

>Russia started to bombard Ukraine. I live in Ukraine. Stay strong fellows.

I have read the words of sympathy from Godot's project manager. But those words will turn into something else further along.

My mind was so focused on the war and survival that I stopped interacting within the Godot community. But then at some point I decided to contact the lead developer to express my position and my relationship with Godot.

I started my conversation with him on the topic of cooperation. I'd lead another project that would provide an alternative or complementing solution to Godot. His reply was:

>There is zero incentive from the Godot project to promote features that were not merged (yet or ever). I'm pretty surprised about your perseverance on this topic for so long. I think I already made it clear that we will not recognize your project nor allow you to do strong promotion of it using our own resources. I have no idea why you believe you can convince me or ""find a way or a backdoor"" into this. You will not find any no matter how hard you try.

I said to him that if he doesn't want to discuss this topic, I asked him to let me know about it, and to be honest, the reason why I kept talking about this topic for so long with was the fact that I was in a bomb shelter, so I decided to at least distract myself, and I told him about this. He said:

>I can imagine its hard and you have my support.

I asked:

>What kind of support are you talking about?

He said:

>I mean that I totally understand the situation you are in, and that it can be very stressing, and that you are a victim in all that is going on. **I don't think there is a lot I can do for you specifically** \[emphasis mine\], but I meant to say that I fully believe what you are going through is real.

It's interesting: why he questioned my perception of reality? I didn't need an external confirmation that what I see is real, as I see the war with my own eyes, so his kind of ""support"" wasn't helpful.

All of a sudden, he started to explain why they haven't banned me so far, and that *I should be thankful* that I still keep interacting in the Godot community. He said:

>If you cross the line you cross the line and we won't be able to protect you.

When you look through the prism of war at the events that surround you, the perception of life becomes clear. And I clearly saw one funny thing: that his rhetoric was similar to Putin's one! Recall the ""crossing red lines for NATO""? You have no idea how many analogies arise, and naturally at that moment I could not help myself telling him about it. Then he replied:

>The project is fine without people like you.

Let me explain what he said is problematic:

* Me and other contributors want to be able to freely share our point of view on various topics. People find contradictions and it's natural that they want to find a way to resolve them. I feel sympathy for people who had to go through the ambiguous development process and get rejected. So I wanted to find a way to help those people find a place.
* I always advocate for **open discussion**, the very principle that Godot publicly declared! If contributors are restricted in the way they must speak, then that's not what constitutes the principle of open-source code and open-discussion in the first place.
* Godot leadership must understand and internalize that the organization they created (or rather a group of people) has entered the **democratic world**. Godot is *not* the center of the world!

Due to this, I got an impression that Godot's governance is moving towards *trustocracy*. If they choose to go this route, they will end up as benevolent dictators as we call them in IT.

Incidentally, the entire Godot community reminded me of Orwell's ""1984""! Recall the Thinkpol? They have already defined me as a dissident and an extremist in their heads, and they have already decided to put the ""Black Spot"" on me...

My point is that no healthy open-source project would say anything like that as an excuse for removing membership, just as Godot does to me and other contributors.

So, their structure of logical reasoning comprises mostly of manipulation. This kind of reasoning may be interpreted as a powerful charisma, unfortunately. Putin also presented himself as a quite charismatic and a loving person to the entire world, until he decided to attack Ukraine... The problem is that Putin is still seen as a hero by some... That's how powerful brainwashing could get. Petty tyrants and big tyrants are similar in one thing - hypocrisy and lies, it all depends on their influence on society. Putin influences Russia, and the lead developer of Godot influences Godot's community. This is my analogy that I've noticed, and I am a living witness to this.

Later on, I said to him that my behavior is the behavior of a free person, and he does not have any right to restrict my way of expression. I also mentioned that this kind of attitude is an inherent trait of a lot of Ukrainians, due to our culture and mentality. Then he said:

>This has nothing to do with Ukrainians, this only has to do with you.  
>  
>Don't shield yourself in people who are suffering.  
>  
>If you behave like an ass, it's about you, not about Ukrainians.  
>  
>**You don't represent Ukrainians to me.** \[emphasis mine\]

I thought: ""Wow..."". I hope you understand what he said was unacceptable:

* I **am** suffering from the war.
* I **am** an Ukrainian, a citizen of Ukraine, have an Ukrainian passport, and even an authentic Ukrainian surname. I'm a Cossack descendant, by the way!
* Even if we assume for a moment that I'm an ass, he still has no right to deny my national      identity!

A year ago, the lead developer said to me:

>Not pissing others off is more important than trying to understand others.

But he failed not to piss *me* off!

From that moment on, I decided that I'd never contribute to Godot again. However, due to my personal attachment to Godot, I've found various excuses to continue *using* the product, especially when I'm a co-author of it.

# Russian influence on Godot leadership and governance model

*Disclaimer*: *I'm not against Russians specifically. I'm against everyone who kills people of Ukraine, and I'm against everyone who justifies action or inaction of Russian citizens that keep supporting Putin's regime. It just happens that the majority of people who live in Russia do support the atrocities that happen in Ukraine now on some level or another, and some Russians around the world infect other people with fascism propaganda. There is a legitimate reason why* /r/russia *is quarantined. I know this as an Ukrainian.*

There exists one Russian member in Godot (lets call him ""Yuri""). Yuri joined Godot community around 2021. I've been contributing to Godot's development for like 3 years at that time already. He was accepted into the inner Godot cult with ease. His offensive attitude to people allowed him to adapt. By offensive behavior I mean passive-aggressive, since he worked hard to spread the word of Godot and shut down everyone who ""spread misinformation about Godot"", according to his words.

I once talked to him in private, and the most interesting part was his last words. He said (translated from Russian):

>And don't speak to me using ""Mr."", we're not in **Verkhovna Rada** \[emphasis mine\].

For your information, **Verkhovna Rada** in Ukraine is equivalent to the **United States Congress**. He was perfectly aware of existing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and that I'm an Ukrainian. Why would he find it absolutely necessary to passively-aggressively touch politics, when all we talked about was technical stuff?

He changed his nickname right after Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. He said that he doesn't want to be associated with the war. Turns out that, if you read his old nickname in Russian (interpreting Latin symbols as Cyrillic), this literally means: **Russian Warrior**!

I always asked myself: why a person like him, for such a short period of time, managed to enter the organization and became an influential member of Godot? I decided to research whether Godot has anything to do with Russia. I've stumbled upon this article:

* [Godot Engine receives $120,000 grant from game development studio Kefir](https://web.archive.org/web/20210429105705/https://godotengine.org/article/godot-engine-receives-120000-grant-from-kefir)

And this is the answer! $120,000 was enough for Godot leadership to close their eyes on everything Russian participants do in Godot communities and to ban an Ukrainian. Read on!

Kefir is a Russian game development studio. Everything seemed to be fine, until I read the quote presented there. The author of that quote is **Alyosha Stalin** \- Chief Business Development Officer at Kefir. Here's an explanation of the name:

* [Stalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin) is a Soviet political leader and dictator who caused massive genocide of Ukrainian people called ""Holodomor"".
* ""Stalin"" is not a Russian surname. It's a pseudonym for ""Man of Steel"", similarly to ""Lenin"", it doesn't exist as a surname in Russia.
* ""Alyosha"" is just a byname of the full name ""Alexey"".

Just like ""Stalin"" is a pseudonym, so is Alyosha Stalin. This means that **Godot has accepted a donation from someone who adores Stalin**. Perhaps Yuri is from Kefir as well? I suppose there should be some connection at least, I don't know. But my point is that Godot appears to attract Russian developers. Why? Because they likely share the same governance model of Godot and find it as a perfect environment where their behavior can be tolerated, and where their behavior could even thrive!

# Democracy has not won

My final day at Godot was at the moment when I watched a [video by our Ukrainian spokesperson Oleksii Goncharenko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oLeczZoMGM). I shared the video at **#coffee-break** channel at Godot Contributors Chat, and presented it *as an example* of free opinion voicing, in hopes that this could inspire people in Godot to understand what **freedom of speech** means in the first place, and eventually internalize it.

After I shared the video, someone from Godot members said:

>Well, the main conclusion I seem to draw is that you are trying to make a connection with your exclusion from the \[Godot\] org with things that are quite different and an order of magnitude more impactful. I think it's a quite an unfortunate comparison, which, in a way, kind of make the point of the \[Godot\] leadership decision \[*to remove my membership in Godot*\]

Do you see how they refuse to accept any kind of analogies? This kind of manipulation technique allows them to sustain the current status quo by pushing back anything coming from outside. This way of thinking is apparent when the lead developer asks that [people should not compare Godot to any other technology](https://twitter.com/reduzio/status/1213828214180786179), which is ridiculous considering that people do this *all the time*. That's how we learn as well!

Our conversation quickly switched to the topic of **human rights**, and I've explained how Godot violates my right to freedom of speech (they forbidden me to quote anyone, under any circumstance, I'm not allowed to talk about other members and even myself).

Later on, Yuri appeared! He said:

>I have to say that anyone's involvement with the project is **not a part of any free speech paradigm** \[emphasis mine\]. Anyone can be directly (by a personal ""firing"") or indirectly (via the established and agreed upon terms of engagement **that make you quit** \[emphasis mine\]) removed from the project, at least in the official capacity. There is **no inherent right to contribute to Godot, so the org can oust anybody for its arbitrary reasons** \[emphasis mine\].

Again, Yuri is the official member within Godot organization, accepted by Godot. The leadership agrees to what he says. Here's why what he said is problematic:

* The right to freedom of speech is seen as some kind of disadvantage (to whom?)
* There exist procedures that ""make you quit"" on your own in Godot (cyberbullying, pointing to      the door, boycotting, cancelling, you name it).
* Everyone should feel welcomed to contribute to the project right from the start, so people *do      have* inherent right to contribute to Godot, just like in other open-source, community-driven projects.
* People can be booted from the project for any arbitrary reason! For instance, when you talk about freedom of speech!

Therefore, the approach described by Yuri is fairly unprofessional, no *healthy* open source organization would do any of those things.

He continued saying \[emphasize mine on **trust**\]:

>We just choose to **trust** that those reasons are valid and are upheld in the interest of the larger community.  
>  
>Every work is based on **trust**, and hard as you might, **trust** may just disappear one day, or never appear in the first place.

Do you see how they keep fixating on **trust**?

After my long reply regarding the Godot's principle of open discussion, democratic world and the human rights that represent this democratic world, Yuri replied:

>Godot is open-source, but it's not just anyone's. There are specific leaders. **You either align with them or not** \[emphasis mine\].

I replied:

>What can you expect from a person who lives in Russia...

You see, I can totally understand why he would think that there's no other choice. He lives in Russia, where Putin's regime does not let him express his opinion about the war, and not the ""special military operation"", otherwise he'd go in jail. But why this way of thinking has to be spread inside Godot, an open-source, community-driven project? Toxic leaders must be challenged, otherwise those leaders will rule the world of fascism! Am I right?

He said:

>But Godot isn't a country

Later on I explained to him a one important thing to realize. I said:

>A person who lives in a fascist country is infected by fascism and spreads it, no matter where that person is located. If you don't believe me, google up ""14 signs of fascism"" and ask yourself: in what kind of country do you live?

You can verify this for yourself if you read the book called ""Pandemic fascism"". Again, there's a reason why /r/russia is literally quarantined here on Reddit.

They thought that I'd like to establish a democratic way of organization in Godot. But I wasn't implying that. Most open-source projects are based on *meritocracy* indeed. When I talk about democracy, I meant that if you enter a democratic world, you must abide to **democratic principles** on the level of basic human rights.

Then one of the members said:

>lol, and what exact right did we remove you? Free speech? You are still talking here. And no one prevents you from bringing your opinion on twitter or else tbh  
>  
>But even then, **free speech does not apply here, and I really hope it will never do**. \[emphasis mine\]

Later on, another member said:

>Note, people are not getting removed/banned because others wake up with the wrong foot one day. This just means that Code of Conduct is a guideline and if people are found to be disruptive to the development/community they may be removed **even if they didn't explicitly breach one of the rules in the CoC** \[emphasis mine\].

This is called permissiveness and iniquity. It means that the leadership of Godot allow themselves to do whatever they want with people, however they want it. This is also the moment when they figured that their governance model is actually trustocratic! What originally meant to be *meritocracy* became *do-ocracy*, and eventually *trustocracy*. Here's what they said:

>Yeah, it's not really a meritocracy. Juan calls it a ""do-ocracy"", where the ones who worked enough (and their work merged) on some specific areas of the code can decide on what's get merged.  
>  
>But ultimately, the fact you become a maintainer mostly relies on other maintainers and the leadership trust on you and your work I believe. There's no really an ""official guide to become a maintainer"".  
>  
>Can we call that a ""trustocracy""? xD

# Summary execution

Apparently, Yuri got offended by what I said. He didn't tell me this, but all of a sudden, Godot's project manager appeared! He said:

>It's the second time today you're overtly racist Xrayez. This has to stop.

At first, he accused me of racism. Then, other member suggested another term: xenophobia. The project manager agreed that: ""Maybe better term yes.""

Or ""extremism"", as [Maria Zakharova says](https://twitter.com/ukraine_world/status/1512419496602083337). ;)

They couldn't come up with a specific accusation because they didn't really care at this point. There was no genuine explanation or proof of accusation. Zero dialogue.

Moments later, the project manager said:

>I give up trying to reason with you. We can't reach an agreement on how to work together, so we shouldn't work together. You don't want to make things work, and **you don't want to leave** \[emphasis mine\], so the only option left for us is to ban you from Godot communities.  
>  
>That saddens me because I estimate you as a person and I'm appalled by the situation you're in your real life, **but we can't help you** \[emphasis mine\].

Ask yourself: if you were to manage an international project, knowing that there exist both Russian and Ukrainian contributors, and knowing that Russia is the aggressor that caused literal genocide of people in Ukraine (both in the past and now), what would you do in a situation like this as a project manager?

If the project manager cared about me, as the only active Ukrainian contributor in Godot, he wouldn't decide to permanently ban an Ukrainian. Is this how they express sympathy and compassion? No. This is a clear example of Putin's rhetoric, once again. Just a blatant lie and hypocrisy. The sympathy that the project manager allegedly expresses is the sympathy of an executioner who raises an ax over the head of an innocent person.

After that, I did not ask to remove the ban. What I did, however, is to contact Godot leadership for an request to deliver their official stance and reason for the permanent ban via email, just like all responsible people do. They haven't responded. Nothing at all. In other words, **they cancelled me**.

When I got **permanently banned** for real, do you know what I felt?

Freedom!

# Call to conscience

Weeks later after my permanent ban from all Godot communities and the lack of response from Godot leadership, I have decided to write this kind of letter directed to Godot's project manager:

&#x200B;

>Hi Rémi,  
>  
>I hope that you read this letter and I don't have to bring up the reason why I'm writing a letter to you. I also remind you that I have sent another letter to all Godot leadership members.  
>  
>If you think that my polite way of speaking to you is just another type of trolling that you allegedly have to deal with, I can use overt words to deliver my message instead, and perhaps that might change the way you see myself, without any ""insinuations"", as you say. Therefore, without further ado, I'll switch to an explicit language that could hopefully convey what I want to tell you.  
>  
>As you recall, you called myself a racist (oh yeah, I forgot, you immediately changed your accusation to ""xenophobia"", because you change accusations and contributors just like a pair of gloves). You provided so-called evidence of ""racism"" to me as the following:  
>  
>\> ""What can you expect from a person who lives in Russia...""  
>  
>If you think that what I said is a racist statement, then you're either stupid, a provocateur, a scandalist, or just a piece of scoundrel, or everything in between, or everything combined.  
>  
>When the entire world condemned the fascist Russia, you called me a racist, but I treat your accusation towards myself as an overt support of Putin's regime. The fact that I'm from Ukraine and that my city gets bombarded does not stop you from your accusations. You can put your lousy and hypocritical so-called ""compassion"" into your ass.  
>  
>I will do everything within my strength to subject your organization under financial sanctions for dealing with Russian organizations that sponsor terrorism. That terrorism also includes arbitrary bans of people that you don't agree with. The Ukrainian government is ready to help me in this regard.  
>  
>Literally, I used to be the only Ukrainian who had membership privileges within Godot organization, and now you permanently banned myself from all interaction within the Godot community. You and other leadership members constantly use the ""Bad character evidence"" against me (in my case, there's only slander towards my character). And I can assure you, I have all the proofs of your vile conduct, and I will provide every proof for each case until the end. For example, one of the Godot leadership members said to me in private:  
>  
>\> ""You don't represent Ukrainians to me.""  
>  
>The above sentence is insulting both within and out of context, because it overtly denies my national identity. The fact that there exist two Russian Godot contributors who are literally members within the Godot organization makes the entire accusation of racism towards myself even more ridiculous and proves the fact of discrimination based on the national identity.  
>  
>If you think that my intentions are not serious, think again and again, because repetition is the mother of learning. I advise you to ponder upon this. I have nothing to lose. I'm willing to defend my human rights in the international court, if needed.  
>  
>You could've literally avoid all troubles by saying that you're sorry and eventually fuck off. But noooo... You come up with fucked up, perverted conclusions. Somehow, you see yourself entitled to so-called protection. The irony is that people never get offended in the first place. Have you asked them whether they need your fucking protection? For God's sake, just let us have a free and open discussion.  
>  
>I will not tolerate this, and I treat your attitude as never-ending harassment and groundless accusations towards myself. You must resign from the position of a project manager in Godot Engine. I suggest you find a new job that better matches your skills.  
>  
>P.S. If you don't reply, I will reveal our discussion to the general public. The irony is that the Godot's image that you're eagerly trying to protect could be destroyed with your own hands.

As you've probably figured, the project manager haven't replied to this letter either. 😉

# Conclusion

I strongly assert that Godot does not follow the principle of **open discussion** despite appearances, therefore it cannot be called a **community-driven** project. Talking about past decisions, development philosophy, governance and questioning actions of existing members is heavily frowned upon, and people get punished for expressing their honest opinion. I wouldn't be surprised if someone from Godot fanbase will come here and say nasty things about me and this post gets downvoted! But this doesn't matter as much, what matters to me is raising awareness.

I'm afraid that Godot exploit people's desire of belonging to a group. Whether the decisions of Godot's leadership are conscious is irrelevant. People end up spending their lives working on a project with ambiguous vision and get permanently booted from the project when they try to challenge the toxic leadership once they get more experience, while a project keeps receiving donations from sponsors that also get deluded. The political agenda does not inspire any confidence either.

I have learnt that you cannot get something for free, nothing is free. if you don't pay with money, you pay with your time, work and sacrificing life in general.

Do you think democracy and freedom of speech are at stakes nowadays? Feel free to share your thoughts!",6,12,1652966426.0

### 5. Petit bourgeois and middle class

In our struggle today, we are facing a growing demon in society that poses the greatest danger to the revolution. We can say that especially in Rojava (west) and Bakur (north), but in general in all regions of struggle, the class that is the biggest obstacle to the revolution is the petty bourgeoisie class, the middle class. According to Marxist literature, during the class struggle of feudalism, the bourgeois class is called the middle class.

At that time, the main ruling class is the aristocracy (king, landlord, landowner, etc.). The bourgeoisie moves to power, it wants to destroy the feudal system and develop a system that corresponds to the characteristics of the bourgeois class. Today the middle class is the petty bourgeoisie, but we should not fall into the mistake of trying to define this class only by its material-economic basis. Nowadays, class boundaries are not as sharp and clear as they used to be.

Things have become confused and intertwined. We want to talk more about the understanding and consciousness of this class. In this sense, a peasant and worker can also behave like a petty bourgeois and possess the characteristics of the middle class.

**In essence, who is the petty bourgeois?**

Those who live the culture of the bourgeois class like to be bourgeois and want to become bourgeois. They are somewhat removed from the material living conditions of the proletariat and represent an intermediate class, that is, a middle class. They are in the society, like the bourgeois-capitalist, but they are not completely apart from the society, however, the middle class is always trying to become rich and grow and therefore it is open to everything and they in no way lose their status.

Since the measure of merit in this system is not labor itself, but theft, robbery and deception, they can practice treason and collaborate with the enemy. During the revolution, the middle class is the one that positions itself in society, most against the revolution. They are opportunistic, they do not go into the struggle. They stay in the middle and stand with those who are stronger, who get more results.

They always look for a compromise with the enemy and are fearful and cowardly until the end. They are very radical in easy times, but in difficult times they seem not to be, because they know how to hide and camouflage their truth. The personality of this class is completely liberal and contains all the characteristics of a liberal personality.

**Some characteristics of the petty-bourgeois and bourgeois personality:**

* Imitates the external, so it does not live itself, it imitates the capitalist/ bourgeois class;
* Selfish;
* Is opportunistic, that is, she shuns conflict and adapts to her environment, like a flag in the wind, whichever way the wind blows, it goes;
* Their line is not clear, they do not join the struggle in the revolution with everything, always has one foot in the present system;
* Lives from the work of other people, but distinguishes itself with this work;
* Dreamy, i.e. lives in dreams that are far from the reality of life;
* Complains and laments, but does not see itself as a part of it, does not propose a solution;
* Liar and a demagogue;
* Emotional and gives up quickly;
* Always waits for some people to deal with;
* Likes themselves (ego);
* There is no fight and resistance in them, they can be very radical, but does not put it into practice;
* The style of this class: they show themselves modern and progressive, but they are not clear, effeminate, without principles, not productive, populist and unstable.

*A second brochure continuation will be made as it approaches and analyse the socialist personality.*",8,0,1661713537.0
12nmmwt,Marxism,The Fundamental Problem With Revisionism?,unnaturalfood,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marxism/comments/12nmmwt/the_fundamental_problem_with_revisionism/,"I was hoping to have this be a sort of question/place of discussion. I am a socialist, heavily inspired by Marx. Whether I would be classified as a Marxist is something I am somewhat unsure of and accept would likely be up to one's definition of the word Marxist. As I said, I see Marx (and many of his later followers such) as some of the greatest social scientists and economists of our era, but, due to the fact I have some points where I disagree with him, and due to the ambiguity of the term, generally just opt to call myself a socialist. 

All that out of the way, I was hoping to learn a bit more about why most Marxists I have seen are so opposed to revisionism, as a concept. Though I have seen arguments over whether certain thinkers and leaders were revisionist or not, I have nearly always seen these discussions based on the assumption that revisionism is fundamentally a negative. Based on my understanding of Marx, he was heavily opposed to religious orthodoxy, and the sort of domination of certain interpretations as the sole 'truth' above all others. Additionally, I have often seen Marxism touted as a living science, a fact I think is very much in its favorite. As monumental of a thinker as Marx was, he did live in the 1800s and, naturally, in order to continue his legacy, Marxism must be willing to adapt to the conditions of time and place. In view of these things, why then, is 'revision' of potentially outdated or overlooked aspects in orthodox Marxist thought fundamentally bad? Shouldn't Marxism opt to revise itself so as to best suit the everchanging needs and conditions of the working class? I fully accept I may be operating on a different definition of revisionism than most Marxists, or that not all (or even most) Marxists are anti-revisionist, or that I perhaps made some other fundamental error, but am asking this question in genuine good faith and curiosity, and in the hopes of productive discussion.",19,31,1681600836.0
133icjr,Marxism,The Majority Principle,Para_Scheva_,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marxism/comments/133icjr/the_majority_principle/,"Democracy in the sense of the majority principle is only a practical means through which a general interest is enforced. As such, due to the division of society into classes with opposing interests, democracy which encompasses all classes is absurd. It is then the task of the proletariat to openly impose its own specific class interest. However because the majority principle is only a practical means to the end of representing that interest, not being an end in itself, then even within a class (here the proletariat), it should not be raised to the level of a principle, but only to that of a tactic (albeit the best one to aim for in most cases). Thus democracy in the sense of the imposition of the objective class interest of the proletariat (which is synonymous with the dictatorship of the proletariat) is not necessarily tied to the majority principle, and in some cases broad participation, while in others swift executive action, can be the most practical means of enforcing this dictatorship / democracy. 

The issue as posed by Bordiga in 1922 (keep in mind that his position here is different to the one he would adopt later on):

""The division of society into classes distinguished by economic privilege clearly removes all value from majority decision-making. Our critique refutes the deceitful theory that the democratic and parliamentary state machine which arose from modern liberal constitutions is an organization of all citizens in the interests of all citizens. From the moment that opposing interests and class conflicts exist, there can be no unity of organization, and in spite of the outward appearance of popular sovereignty, the state remains the organ of the economically dominant class and the instrument of defence of its interests. In spite of the application of the democratic system to political representation, bourgeois society appears as a complex network of unitary bodies. Many of these, which spring from the privileged layers and tend to preserve the present social apparatus, gather around the powerful centralized organism of the political state. Others may be neutral or may have a changing attitude towards the state. Finally, others arise within the economically oppressed and exploited layers and are directed against the class state. Communism demonstrates that the formal juridical and political application of the democratic and majority principle to all citizens while society is divided into opposed classes in relation to the economy, is incapable of making the state an organizational unit of the whole society or the whole nation. Officially that is what political democracy claims to be, whereas in reality it is the form suited to the power of the capitalist class, to the dictatorship of this particular class, for the purpose of preserving its privileges.

(...)

It is clear that the principle of democracy has no intrinsic virtue. It is not a ""principle"", but rather a simple mechanism of organization, responding to the simple and crude arithmetical presumption that the majority is right and the minority is wrong. Now we shall see if and to what extent this mechanism is useful and sufficient for the functioning of organizations comprising more restricted collectivities which are not divided by economic antagonisms. To do this, these organizations must be considered in their process of historical development.

Is this democratic mechanism applicable in the dictatorship of the proletariat, i.e. in the state form born from the revolutionary victory of rebel classes against the power of the bourgeois states? Can this form of state, on account of its internal mechanism of the delegation of powers and of the formation of hierarchies, thus be defined as a ""proletarian democracy""? The question should be broached without prejudice, because if although we might reach the conclusion that the democratic mechanism is useful under certain conditions, as long as history has not produced a better mechanism, we must be convinced that there is not the slightest reason to establish a priori the concept of the sovereignty of the ""majority"" of the proletariat. In fact the day after the revolution, the proletariat will not yet be a totally homogeneous collectivity nor will it be the only class. In Russia for example, power is in the hands of the working class and the peasantry, but if we consider the entire development of the revolutionary movement, it is easy to demonstrate that the industrial proletarian class, although much less numerous than the peasantry, nevertheless plays a far more important role. Then it is logical that the Soviet mechanism accords much more value to the vote of a worker than that of a peasant.

We do not intend to examine thoroughly here the characteristics of the proletarian state constitution. We will not consider it metaphysically as something absolute, as reactionaries do the divine right of the monarchy, liberals, parliamentarism based on universal suffrage, and anarchists, the non-state. As it is an organization of one class destined to strip the opposing classes of their economic privileges, the proletarian state is a real historical force which adapts itself to the goal it pursues, that is, to the necessities which gave birth to it. At certain moments its impulse may come from either broad mass consultations or from the action of very restricted executive organs endowed with full powers. What is essential is to give this organization of proletarian power the means and weapons to destroy bourgeois economic privilege and the political and military resistance of the bourgeoisie, in a way that prepares for the subsequent disappearance of classes themselves, and for the more and more profound modifications of the tasks and structure of the proletarian state.""

(If you need background on tipping points, consult this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxoyaCSWFGs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxoyaCSWFGs) ).

Here's my current thinking:

* Suffienct CO2 reduction is impossible under capitalism.
* Capitalism will be overthrown in the imperial periphery before the imperial core (in most cases).- Overthrowing capitlaism will take many decades in the imperial periphery, and even more decades in the imperial core.
* Therefore, capitalism will survive long enough for earth to inevitably hit carbon tipping points.
* Tipping points will trigger the earth to release more carbon than we humans ever could. Once we hit a handful of tipping points, all climate action on CO2 becomes meaningless. For example, there's no point greening our economies if the Amazon is self-deforesting because of droughts which cause more self-deforesting which cause more draughts... etc.

Conclusion:

* The left should abandon CO2 reduction.
* The left should pivot to climate adaptation & climate justice.
* The left should prioritize environmental issues in order of how impactful they are to public health.

... What do you guys think?  I know this sounds doomerist, but if you think I'm just being needlessly pessimistic, answer me a few questions:

2. What decade do you think the highest CO2 emmitting countries will abandon the capitalist mode of production?

12afe2r,Marxism,Is post modernism the killer of objectivity or the death of it led to post modernist thought?,danichimarques,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marxism/comments/12afe2r/is_post_modernism_the_killer_of_objectivity_or/,"The title is intentional to cause some unconfort for some of u, in a good way tho kkkk

well, now that I have your attention I really would like to have this discussion, the death of objectivity is methodological thought and in perception to the obtention of knowledge as the scientific positivism got it's last breath from pseudociences and oppressive utilization from the fascists of the first half of the last century. Perceiving the scientific method as not a objective seeking pursuit, but one that systemazes relative observations in a pursuit of an absolute explanation to a phenomena is in my view a really big step in how we do science and how we theorize phenomena, being it from the hard sciences or our social ones.

With the relativization of reality I think that objectivity and subjectivity as a means of analysing worth of a conclusion become a reificated differentiation. We don't really are able to perceive reality in every single way that we can imagine, and there is the possibility of there being other ways, so we are restricted to select variables, and those making our analysis relative to something, no more subjective as any other restriction nor more objetive that any other method. Only more or less absolute to the totally of that particular phenomena in study.

I already have been called to post modernist by some comrades and I don't really understand how, calling me neo-marxist it could be valid ig, because I use sociology and gender studies to adapt Marxist thought and being myself someone that does science in a negative methodology in opposition to the modernism positivist basis makes sense in applying the term ig.

Is Marxism about Marx?,OhCountryMyCountry,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marxism/comments/10v3rlu/can_marxism_survive_without_the_ltov_is_marxism/,"Can Marxism survive without the LToV? That is not an attack on Marxism, but a call for potential adaptation. Marxism has been static and unchangeable for decades, and relys on the work of a man that was not even alive at the time of the transition away from classical economics and towards marginalist economics. Marx may not have liked marginalist economics, or may have accepted it as he accepted much of classical economics, but I think it is foolish to support a >100 year old set of theories when it may make more sense to adapt them.

Neo-classical (i.e. marginalist) economics is not compatible with a LToV, so maybe that is our issue. But it is compatible with an Iron Law of Wages (the law that in a free market, unless there is a constant expansion of demand for labour, workers are paid at subsistence levels over the long run), and can still express that wages under capitalism are too low for the short run, compared to the level necessary of reproducing labour in the long run. Many of us are married to the idea that our incomes are under our aspirations because we are robbed of surplus value. Marginalist economics does not allow that view. But it *does* allow us to argue for many of our positions in a way that is not out of line with a lot of Marx’s other views (or more importantly, it gives us a more accurate image of the economic world than either Marx’s 150+ year old classically inspired theories, or the highly partial and obscurantists mainstream neo-classical theory of today).

By granting capital the sole possession of the marginalist/neo-classical domain, Marxists/left wingers have allowed for the most acquisitive and reactionary elements to dominate an entire theoretical domain, rather than to contest for control over it’s output. Marx was an impressive man, but the LToV, like all classical theories of objective value, including those that were capital-aligned, are untenable as of ~1890. Marx taught us a lot, but was still a classical economist at heart. It is lazy after over 100 years that we are not adapting our criticisms to take into account advances of economic theory.",0,18,1675680914.0
11b7503,Marxism,"Awhile ago I found an article that tracked the origins and consequences of the ""slate system"" of elections employed by most socialist parties and organizations regardless of tendency. I think there is an argument to be made that this system is inherently undemocratic and has lead to abuses of power.",communist-crapshoot,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marxism/comments/11b7503/awhile_ago_i_found_an_article_that_tracked_the/,"Firstly, for those unfamiliar with it, the slate system is essentially a way to conduct elections in many past and contemporary socialist parties/orgs in which candidates for party/org positions run as a group or ""slate"" with a common platform as opposed to individually. Furthermore party members are generally not allowed to nominate individuals to run for certain positions but must instead nominate an entire slate of individuals to run for all contestested positions. In practical terms this means that you cannot simply support or oppose one person's bid for an office you have to support or oppose an entire group of people (usually between 5 and 19 depending on the size of the organization, though some past parties have had as many as 52 contested positions in their highest ruling bodies). Additionally if you want to run for a position yourself you've got to find between 4 and 18 (or 51) people to run for the other available positions together as a slate with you in it. Finally because slates are nominally supposed to represent different platforms if your slate has too much in common with your opponent's then one of the groups will usually be ""encouraged"" by the outgoing chairman (this position goes by many names in different orgs but exists in almost all of them) to drop out of the election to ""avoid confusion"". In cases where only a single slate has been nominated (which is usually the case) the choice presented to voters is not for a slate but rather a binary ""yes""/""no"" vote on whether they support the only slate running. In very rare cases a majority ""no"" vote results in that slate shuffling some of its members out for more popular ones or dropping this or that part of their platform but this hardly ever happens in practice and when it does occur it is usually in response to a major crisis at which point it is too little too late.

The end result of all of this is that usually only a single slate is ever nominated (usually by the outgoing leadership, who perhaps unsurprisingly only ever nominate themselves or their closest followers) and wins with ""unanimous"" approval (because opposition voices rarely meet all the byzantine qualifications and thus lose by default) and all critics to this outcome are silenced by pointing to its supposedly revolutionary tradition/the ubiquity of this system across the far-left.

Now that that is out of the way here is the article which traced the history of this system: [https://rupture.ie/articles/the-origins-of-the-slate-system](https://rupture.ie/articles/the-origins-of-the-slate-system)

Now I'm not saying that this system is the only thing responsible for the socialist left's historic political misfortunes, or even the main thing, but it's definitely a major part of it. Without real democracy in our orgs there will naturally form self-selecting and self-perpetuating cliques of men and women who can and will make programmatic mistakes, fail to learn from them, fail to adapt to new circumstances, be  rigid in their analyses, stick to their own dogma after it has been disproven by experience thus alienating the masses, abuse their power to embezzle the dues of their constituencies, abuse those under them both physically, sexually and psychologically, all this and a whole host of other horrors, not least of which is to render our orgs impotent by perverting them into little more than personality cults and thus condemning us to the continued miseries and indignities of the capitalist system which these orgs were ostensibly founded to combat.",19,10,1677285535.0
10vutri,Marxism,What did Marx said about other alternatives to Capitalism?,Wrahms,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marxism/comments/10vutri/what_did_marx_said_about_other_alternatives_to/,"Even in the watered down digested version I get indirectly it is clear that Marx was smart, no doubt about that. I'm not sure I really want to read his own words though. 

What I'm wondering is how Marx decided/designed upon Communism and what did he have to say about other alternatives.

There is also the question of what are the chances of a system designed largely theoretically, even if based on facts and valid reasoning, to succeed. Data is always incomplete and theories always have holes and the more complex the system the more anomalies you will find. Does Communism or other systems have the adaptability to change themselves so that these anomalies are accounted for or don't cause mayor disruptions?

Even further, which do you think is the most adaptive system? ""The peak of evolution"" so to speak. And if none can last forever, can we have any idea on the likely or the better course of these systems.

I wonder this because as a musician I've seen the rise and fall of compositional systems and the ones designed a-priori last the least. Plus I have experimented with various systems and styles and it takes a lot of educated trial and error to come up with one that produces good music and even harder one that allows for good large scale structures to be composed in a reasonable time.

Anyway, as we are in a general ""everything crisis"" that the ""great transformation"" is supposed to solve, if we survive what will happen to Capitalism? Do you think Capitalism would have lasted forever if we had managed to terraform and colonize other planets?",0,12,1675751188.0

utctx5,LibertarianSocialism,Is social media fundamentally fixable?,HealthMotor8651,https://www.reddit.com/r/LibertarianSocialism/comments/utctx5/is_social_media_fundamentally_fixable/,"I am going to ask this question in a couple different subreddits, both leftist, liberal, and tech oriented to hear as many responses as possible. If you see it there, that is why.

Social media is broken (yes I recognize the irony of asking this on reddit, one of the largest social media platforms in existence). I think this is something we can all agree on. Complaining, however, doesn't actually accomplish anything. What we should ask is this: how can we fix it?

I have spent a lot of time thinking about this and to be honest I really don't have an answer.

Here's the fundamental problem: all rules and regulations on social media are fundamentally unenforceable due to the sheer volume of content.

So, the whole point of social media is to connect people. Social media sites do this by linking together similar or related communities. So for example, if you're in a dog walking group you might also like to join a group dedicated to photos of dogs. Or if you're in a hearts or iron 4 group, you might want to join a Victoria II group that sorta thing. Social media does this for all interests and groups because that is the point. It is literally in the name, social networks. The point is to create networks. This would be true regardless of the economic system, socialist, capitalist, it doesn't matter because the whole point of social networks is to establish NETWORKS. The technology exists solely for that purpose. We can argue about incentives of different systems making this worse or not all the live long day, but at the end of the day the fundamental issue is the network effect.

This network effect can also lead to extremism. Right now, social media prioritizes high engagement content cause that keeps you on the network longer. But honestly, even if it didn't, just by connecting people it can still funnel people into extremism. The process would be slower and longer, but still would exist. I have personal experienced this. If not for social media, and the arguments and learning I have had here on reddit and on YouTube, I wouldn't be socialist today, I would be like a moderate liberal or right libertarian. Networking exposes you to new ideas. This has both positive and negative effects. 

So then, can't we just ban extreme content? How's that working out right now? The sheer volume of content put on social media makes it damn near impossible to filter, and even the filters in place today are attacked on limits to free speech or whatever (I'm sure that argument will be interesting in comments). But regardless of your stance on that, the practical effect is really difficult to moderate. Shit moves fast online, nazis and the like use code words and dog whistles that censors may not detect. You can ban accounts, but then they just pop back up under a different username. You can ban the ip, but they'll just use a VPN. You can require facial recognition to register, but how do you gurantee that they'll present their face to camera? That the person you're verifying is really the one using the account? That's not to even mention ever evolving bots and the like learning to get past filters. Or hell, most social networks originate in the anglophone world, how are you gonna police this stuff in Thai or Arabic? You're gonna need more bots and translators and the rest, and each of these can adapt at the same or greater speeds than the English world. See the issue?

Plus that's not even to get into the whole problem of predators and abusers using social media to stalk or manipulate their victims or other problems to constant comparison effecting mental health, cyber bullying, etc. And of course, should the extremists not like your content rules, they can always go form their own platform (Parler and Gab for example).

Social media, above all else, allows people to connect. This means both good and bad things. Those who we may not want to connect now can. Nut cases and conspiracy theories can now find adherents and those adherents can find each other and unite to try and combat their conspiracies, whether that be chemicals or fuckin QAnon. Nazis from around the country can find each other. Extremists of all stripes can now connect. And to be honest, I don't really see how to stop that short of getting rid of social media and I really don't think that is possible. So what's the solution here? As far as I can tell, there isn't really one. Regulation, abolishing private ownership of social media, or new social media cannot solve this fundamental problem because it is inherent to the technology itself.

Is there anything that can be done?",10,2,1652993712.0

I was thinking about what is it really that separates man from animal? I mean other animals have social structures, even quite complex ones. I mean hell there is even symbiotic interspecies social structures that are very complicated in nature, and yet..... Ocean of difference right? 

Thought. That's what separates us. We organize our thoughts internally through dialogue. Then can express those to each other in a perscise way that no other animal has ever been able to achieve. 

The thing that separates us from animals is the dead mens voices who rattle in our heads. We are able to organize our thoughts, through a language we had no input on. 

From the moment human beings formed a language it was over for the other species of earth for domination of the cycle of life. Billions of years of genetic and behavioral adaption thrown to the wayside and completely dominated by the first species to do social evolution. 

So enjoy mulling that over as the voices of long dead men echo in your head allowing you to have organized thought in a language you didn't create and had very little to do with learning.",1,3,1675269268.0

The claim states that globalization has brought more liquidity into the global economy, meaning that people, products, money and capital can move beyond borders with ease.   
Social democratic states, relying on taxation and organized workers with extensive rights and benefits, have therefore struggled with both labour and capital moving abroad, to countries where labour costs and taxes are lower.

Some have claimed globalization to be the end of socialism and social democracy, meaning that socialists and social democrats, with very communitarian worldviews aren't fit to face the challenges of a global economy that no longer is reliant of the local community.

I'd like to hear if you've heard similar claims and what you think about it.

How do you think social democrats have adapted to the challenges of globalization so far? And considering what has been done and also what challenges we still have ahead of us, how do you think we as social democats should move forward?

&#x200B;

**Preface and personal statement**

I see it necessary to write the following effortpost for several reasons that would together take too long to explain. One that seems clear cut, but will (I assume) be misunderstood or unread by some that should really read it. That the simple form of idea and thesis will be misinterpreted or altogether refused for the simple fact that I am a Democratic Socialist. But I won't care - I'll still write it and it is on you to read it or not, but I highly recommend it especially to those that usually despise me.

Democracy is a term all too known to us in the ""western"" hemisphere, especially in Europe and North America as well as in several states around this globe. As a lot of us apprechiate it for good and obvious reasons, I see democracy inherently in danger. You might ask: what dangers? We all know Authoritarians like Trump, Orban and Bolsonaro. Yeah, they are the obvious threats ... the real ones lie way down beneath, who are often times forgotten until they surface and cry havock. Therefore, I'd like to talk about this topic.

&#x200B;

**The Threats to Democracy**

It is with a certain irony that a fellow country man of mine, Karl Popper, formulated three paradoxes - the one of **freedom** (*total freedom leads to the suppression of the weak by the strong*) , **tolerance** (*unlimited tolerance leads to the disappearance of the same*) and **democracy** (*the possibility of a majority deciding for a tyrant to rule*).

All three are inherently linked with each other, something that Popper must have realised but most other people didn't. He mentioned three forms, in which a democracy can and might threaten itself and those three explain almost every other threat towards it. But he forgot one essential threat that isn't too obvious but combines all three: humanity itself. You may think that I am crazy - maybe I am. But if you dig deeper into it, Democracy both lives and dies from humanity and it's participants for a logical reason: no humanity, no democracy.

Now, what is meant by humanity. Certainly not the whole human species, that is for sure. Rather the inherent treats of humanity as a whole. Although we are born and blessed with reason and virtues, we are still carrying our emotions - no one can doubt that. There is no singular person that could say of herself that she is totally reasonable, free of emotions. More than others have quite strong emotions, I count myself to the latter although I try my best to be reasonable. From all emotions that exist, fear or *Angst* (in German) may be the strongest one in politics and the one msot connected with political decisions. Said fear doesn't have to be neutral per se, it can be imaginery or developed on the spot by a dictator or tyrant - we have millions of examples for this.

One example of this are fundamentalist Christian denominations in the US and sometimes in Europe. They feel threatened by the (rapid) changes in society and technology, that laicist governments and democracy could end their religious freedoms and powers. That their whole belief could be undone by a simple democratic vote. So it is easy for them to run towards authoritarian figures that promise them their freedoms that they want to protect at all cost. To protect their way of life and forcing it on others, as it must be the only true one. Same with other groups. Threats are various and often have a nationalistic turn towards them, almost all of them are either not true or imagined.

&#x200B;

Another threat is the sheer lust for power, often followed by indifference. I have seen it with several people both in history and in real life. First they start out as interested in change and advocating for it, often times in a political party. Through an event or something similar, their thinking changes and their drive becomes geared towards a higher political position, preferably on the national level. As soon as they reach said position, something will happen that I call the ""fate of transition"" - either you remain interested in change or you'll adapt to the laziness seen in several governments and parliaments. I saw this with several people in the SPÖ, SPD, Labour and the Democrats (US). That their high position made them lazy, made them indifferent to the problems of the people they were elected to represent. Corruption and other similar actions are one factor, the other is lust for power. To print ones own ideals on the whole of society and nation. The latter not necessary via politics, Social Media giants or other rich people do that already (Elon Musk, Peter Thiel etc.) - we all know it.

These are just some, but arguably the biggest threats of democracy.

&#x200B;

**The Value(s) of Democracy**

I could go and write in this text a lot of definitions of democracy, but all have one problem: they don't go deep enough. Democracy is just more than the rule of the people, of the sovereign, of the majority. No, democracy is as a form of government forced to be an equalizing element in a society, one that has to hear everyones voice, everyone grievances.

Representative democracy rests on the huge pillar, that we as the sovereign elect representatives that speak in our name. In theory this idea makes good sense, in practise though we had to see that several representatives weren't really interested in the position or work we had elected them to. Instead they either ignored us for the prestige, the bribery or the feeling of power over others. Fortunately, not all parts of democracy are merely representative. Some forms are more direct, most famous example is Switzerland with its direct democratic votes.

While some see it as a threat (maybe for a good reason), I spot certain advantages in more direct democratic means. First: it gives the voters a better chance to cast their ballot for a certain cause. Second: it is direct so a government has to heed to it. Third: it can go from local to regional to national matters.  Critique is understandable. Some say that certain individuals (mostly those they agree with) shouldn't be able to participate or launch such votes or referenda. Others claim that it would destruct the concept of democracy itself as it could give rise to authoritarian elements. As of yet, this hasn't happened in Switzerland. Their direct democratic approach is interesting for the simple fact that it is direct, but their history with such means is older than some countries even exist on the map.

&#x200B;

I would summarize the values of democracy in five words: **freedom**, **equality**, **justice**, **solidarity** and **tolerance**. All five have to be in a certain balance to achieve a working democracy, that is both alive and with the least ammount of threats to it. It needs reform as much as the sovereign it is based on. And only democracy can give all of us the voice we need. All five terms carry a certain weight, all five need to be seen as party of a symbiotic relationship - if one weakens or dies, all other do too.

&#x200B;

**The Defense of Democray**

Having established what threats (in general) might loom and what values it has, we now approach the topic of defending this particular form of government. All four powers (Legislative, Executive, Judiciary and the Free Press) are the most well known defenders - in Europe especially the Judiciary with Constitutional Courts or High Courts. A lot of democratic values is based off a Constitution, the de jure rule book for a country in a lot of aspects. Yet, the judiciary alone can't defend democracy as is on its own. The biggest key to defense is simple, but often overlooked: the sovereign itself, the people.

The Washington Post has a motto that was introduced in the early 2010s: ""*Democracy dies in darkness*"". That quote on itself says a lot. Thing is: no one really described what darkness in this context ever meant. Finding a fixed definition is not easy and I won't attempt to find a good one. Darkness can be seen as a lot, but in short: the contrast of darkness is the light. Therefore, democracy can only live in the light.

The light in this case being transparency, an open society, a just society and one where voices are heard. One that casts extremists (read as: those that actively or passively threaten democracy) and authoritarians aside, that sheds light on the problems of the people and the nation. One that is in some way patriotic, but never nationalistic. A society and sovereign, that is able to think and be critical.

In this I assume we all agree. Still, it seems necessary for me to add one thing: that of perspectives. As most of you know, I am a Democratic Socialist and that with pride. I see in Democracy the only way to carry the torch of a better world forward, on a reformist way. While some might argue that I must be an ally or radical Socialists, Commies, Nazis and the like, I would like to say to them: if I am in your view a threat to democracy and democratic means - then what are extremists to you?

I have my squabbles with liberals, conservatives, centrists etc. - but I agree with most of them on one thing: that Democracy is the highest value we have and therefore must protect it at all cost. We sure disagree in how far democracy goes, I for one advocate for more direct democratic means in workplaces and political matters. Others don't, see in representative democracy the best way forward. Yet I still respect them, although I disagree with them on a lot for obvious reasons.

Democracy is more than the idea, it is the action and especially the liveliness that we need to protect. Speaking about it seems fine, but that is apparently the furthest some want to go. Democracy is by necessity required to have an active and engaged sovereign for it to work, for it to remain strong and alive. And while I believe that the Defense of Democracy therefore is the defense of a humanist and fully democratic Socialism, it ain't my first reason to defend it.

Giving the people a voice and acting on it is a necessity, casting any doubt on this is not only dangerous, but actively against all that democracy stands for. Critique is very much apprechiated and required as it keeps both discourse and debate alive. No matter if you work for minimum wage, study at College or are a rich person born into wealth - what unites us is the belief that every ballot, every voice must be heard equally. No different of race, sex, political affiliation or any other factor.

&#x200B;

What I want to say is: while we speak of democracy all the time, we really need to learn to apprechiate it more openly and act on it. It starts at a small pace in ones public life and ends at a national level. As long as we don't fully commit to it, there will always be a threat to it, be an extremist trying to burn it all down. It requires talks, explaining, listening and especially active commitment to it. Listeining to voices and tolerating other views is a necessity, but tolerance has an end too ...

Therefore, let us stand up to what we all want to achieve: full and transparent democratic means!

As previously reported at LeoHohmann.com, the deep state predators in the U.S. and Western governments have decided the world needs a centralized pandemic response controlled and run by the United Nations World Health Organization via an international treaty.

According to the WHO’s website, on March 30, 2021, it announced an “urgent call for an International Pandemic Treaty,” stating that such a treaty is needed to orchestrate a single globalized response to pandemics. And, “25 heads of government and international leaders” have come together in a joint call to form the treaty.

Don’t forget that Yuval Noah Harari, the chief advisor to Klaus Schwab and the World Economic Forum, has stated that globalist elites will use “crises” to bring about world government.

“Catastrophe opens the door” to massive changes that people would otherwise never accept, Harari has said.

Even more pressing than the treaty itself right now, is something almost no one is paying attention to in U.S. political, religious or media circles, and that involves a set of amendments that will set the parameters and define the scope of the proposed new global health treaty. The U.S. government has submitted 13 amendments that it would like to see folded into the treaty, and these amendments are seen by many as sovereignty killers.

A UN report from May 2021 called for more powers for the WHO stating that, “In its current form, the WHO does not possess such powers \[…\]To move on with the treaty, WHO therefore needs to be empowered — financially, and politically.“

The WHO will be hosting its annual meeting, the 75th World Health Assembly, May 22-28 in Geneva, Switzerland, attended by delegates from 192 nations. It is during this meeting that members will be voting on the 13 amendments that will hand over additional sovereignty, control and legal authority to the World Health Organization. The WHO, if these amendments are approved, will obtain the authority to declare an international health emergency, overriding national governments.

In a sense, that already happened in 2020 and 2021, when many of the strictest lockdowns were advised by the WHO and most nations went along with them. But if this treaty is adopted, Katy bar the door because the lockdowns could become even more rigid and more often. Think about the possibilities for a “climate” lockdown.

This means nations will be giving up their sovereignty and rights to control their own healthcare, handing that authority over to an international organization affiliated with the United Nations and run by tyrants like Dr. Tedros.

James Roguski, a researcher and activist who has been studying these amendments, has referred to them as a “five alarm fire” that must be dealt with or they will become part of international law.

These regulations govern the activity of the U.N. World Health Organization.

He says the core of these changes go back to China. Watch the video below:

In the video, Roguski states:

“Whatever we think happened in Wuhan in 2020, the WHO seems to be of the mindset that none of what came afterwards would have happened if they had only been given the power to unilaterally declare an emergency and override the Chinese opposition…. We’re saying it’s an emergency. We’re going to lock everybody down. We’re stepping in…They want to grab power. They’re changing article 12, section 2 and it effectively wipes out 192 nations’ sovereignty to decide whether or not they allow an international organization to step in.”

It is important to note that the International Pandemic Treaty will be far more expansive than these amendments, but these amendments are more urgent because they will be voted on next month.

And no U.S. politician is talking about this. Nor is any mainstream media outlet reporting on it. No pastors are alerting anyone to these monumental, some would say biblical, changes.

Roguski set up the website DontYouDare.info to document the drive to establish this one-world health treaty. The following points are his summary of the draft treaty amendments:

· The International Health Regulations would be legally binding and supersede the United States Constitution.

· The United States has proposed amendments to the legally binding International Health Regulations that will be voted upon at the next World Health Assembly May 22 to May 28. CLICK HERE FOR OFFICIAL DOCUMENT

· These proposed amendments will cede additional sovereignty, control and legal authority over to the World Health Organization.

· These amendments will NOT require approval by 2/3 of the United States Senate. If they are approved (as submitted by the United States) by a simple majority of the 194 member countries of the World Health Assembly countries), these amendments would enter into force as international law just six months later (November 2022). The details of this are not crystal clear.

· It is not known if the amendments will be voted upon individually or as a complete package.

· The amendments will give the director general of the WHO the power to unilaterally declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) even over the objection of the country dealing with an outbreak of disease.

· According to changes made to U.S. regulations that were published one day before Donald Trump was inaugurated (January 19, 2017), the definition of a “Public Health Emergency” in the United States now includes the declaration of a PHEIC by the WHO.

· A unilateral declaration of a PHEIC by the WHO will enable the declaration of a Public Health Emergency by the U.S. Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.

· The amendments proposed by the United States would also give the director general of the WHO the legal authority to unilaterally issue an “intermediate public health alert (IPHA).” The criteria for the issuance of an IPHA is simply that “the Director-General has determined it requires heightened international awareness and a potential international public health response.”

· The amendments will also give “regional directors” within the WHO having the legal authority to declare a Public Health Emergency of Regional Concern (PHERC).

Once you take away national sovereignty and start holding America up against a global standard, that opens up endless opportunities for the elites running the global system to confiscate whatever they believe is “bad for our health.”

What if the WHO decides we all need jabs and digital passports? Wait a minute, the WHO has already decided that! All it lacks is the power to override national governments.

This treaty could also be used to take away Americans’ First and Second Amendment rights. What about the Bible? Is it a matter of your religious faith or is it a tool for “hate speech?” Guns, the Bible and too much free speech are bad for our collective “health” and therefore must be regulated by the WHO.

Kit Knightly, in an article for Off Guardian, also raises the question of countries being punished for “non-compliance” with the new global health treaty. According to the WHO documents:

“\[The treaty should possess\] An adaptable incentive regime, \[including\] sanctions such as public reprimands, economic sanctions, or denial of benefits.“

In other words, Knightly explains:

· If you report “disease outbreaks” in a “timely manner”, you will get “financial resources” to deal with them.

· If you don’t report disease outbreaks, or don’t follow the WHO’s directions, you will lose out on international aid and face trade embargoes and sanctions.

As Patrick Wood reminds us, harsh punishments were already meted out during the Covid pandemic.

“The presidents of Burundi and Tanzania banned the WHO from their borders, refusing to go along with the pandemic narrative: Both died unexpectedly within months and were replaced with pro-WHO Presidents,” Wood writes. “Obviously, the WHO doesn’t care about global health or the life or death of any particular citizen. The warning has been sent out to national leaders: take our deal or we will eliminate you.”

This is a spiritual war, and we are living in a time when all of the prayer warriors must be engaged and called into battle. Pray for people’s eyes to be opened and all deceptions and delusions to be smashed.  


Analysis by [Dr. Joseph Mercola](https://www.mercola.com/forms/background.htm)

**STORY AT-A-GLANCE**

· The World Health Organization has started drafting a global pandemic treaty on pandemic preparedness that would grant it absolute power over global biosecurity, such as the power to implement digital identities/vaccine passports, mandatory vaccinations, travel restrictions, standardized medical care and more

· The WHO is not qualified to make global health decisions. As just one example, the WHO didn’t publicly admit SARS-CoV-2 was airborne until the end of December 2021, yet scientists knew the virus was airborne within weeks of the pandemic being declared. The WHO also ignored early advice about airborne transmission

· More importantly, a one-size-fits-all approach to pandemic response simply does not work, because pandemic threats are not identical in all parts of the world. Even people in the same region do not have identical risk and may not need or benefit from identical treatment

· The WHO will accept two more days of public comment on the treaty, June 16 and 17, 2022, so prepare your statements now. The World Health Assembly will also vote on amendments to the International Health Regulations, May 22-28, 2022, which may also strip away more individual rights and liberties

The globalists that brought us the wildly exaggerated COVID pandemic in an effort to cement a biosecurity grid into place is now hard at work on the next phase of this New World Order.

The World Health Organization has started drafting a global pandemic treaty on pandemic preparedness that would grant it absolute power over global biosecurity, such as the power to implement digital identities/vaccine passports, mandatory vaccinations, travel restrictions, standardized medical care and more.

In “The Corbett Report”1,2 above, independent journalist James Corbett reviews what this treaty is, how it will change the global landscape and strip you of some of your most basic rights and freedoms. Make no mistake, [**the WHO pandemic treaty**](https://takecontrol.substack.com/p/who-pandemic-treaty?s=w) is a direct attack on the sovereignty of its member states, as well as a direct attack on your bodily autonomy.

**A Backdoor to Global Governance**

As noted by anti-extremism activist [**Maajid Nawaz**](https://takecontrol.substack.com/p/hybrid-war?s=r) in an April 28, 2022, Twitter post,3 the “WHO pandemic treaty serves as a backdoor to global empire.”

COVID-19, while potentially deadly to certain vulnerable groups, simply isn’t a valid justification for handing over more power to the WHO, especially in light of its many inexplicable “mistakes” in this and previous pandemics.

As just one example, the WHO didn’t publicly admit SARS-CoV-2 was airborne until the end of December 2021,4 yet scientists knew the virus was airborne within weeks of the pandemic being declared.5 The WHO also ignored early advice about airborne transmission.6

So, it seems clear that the effort to now hand over more power to the WHO is about something other than them being the most qualified to make health decisions that benefit and protect everyone.

It seems far more likely that the WHO is being installed as a de facto governing body for the global Deep State.7 Through the WHO, under the guise of biosecurity, the globalist cabal who seek to own everything and control everyone, will then be able to implement their wishes across the whole world in one fell swoop.

With this treaty in place, all member nations will be subject to the WHO’s dictates. If the WHO says every person on the planet needs to have a vaccine passport and digital identity to ensure vaccination compliance, then that’s what every country will be forced to implement, even if the people have rejected such plans using local democratic processes.

As noted by Corbett, these negotiations are already well underway,8 and the treaty is expected to be fully implemented in 2024 — that is, unless the people of the world wake up to what’s happening and beat back this monstrosity.

**WHO Likely Seeking to Monopolize Health Care Worldwide**

Under the guise of a global pandemic, the WHO, the World Economic Forum (WEF) and all its installed leaders in government and private business, were able to roll out a plan that had already been decades in the making. The pandemic was a perfect cover.

In the name of keeping everyone “safe” from infection, the globalists justified unprecedented attacks on democracy, civil liberties and personal freedoms, including the right to choose your own medical treatment.

Now, the WHO is gearing up to make its pandemic leadership permanent, extend it into the health care systems of every nation, and eventually implement a universal or “socialist-like” health care system as part of The Great Reset.

While this is not currently being discussed, there’s every reason to suspect that this is part of the plan. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has previously stated that his “central priority” as director-general of the WHO is to push the world toward universal health coverage.9

And, considering the WHO changed its definition of “pandemic” to “a worldwide epidemic of a disease,”10 without the original specificity of severe illness that causes high morbidity,11,12 just about anything could be made to fit the pandemic criterion. The whole premise behind this pandemic treaty is that “shared threat requires shared response.” But a given threat is almost never equally shared across regions.

Take COVID-19 for example. Not only is the risk of COVID not the same for people in New York City and the outback of Australia, it’s not even the same for all the people in those areas, as COVID is highly dependent on age and underlying health conditions.

The WHO insists that the remedy is the same for everyone everywhere, yet the risks vary widely from nation to nation, region to region, person to person. They intend to eliminate individualized medicine and provide blanket rulings for how a given threat is to be addressed. Without doubt, this can only result in needless suffering, not to mention the loss of individual freedom.

**How the WHO Has Wielded Previous Pandemic Instruments**

To give us an idea of how the WHO might end up misusing this new proposed international “instrument” on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response, we can look at the International Health Regulations (IHR),13 which the U.S. signed on to in 2005.

The IHR is what empowered the WHO to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).14 This is a special legal category that allows the WHO to initiate certain contracts and procedures, including drug and vaccine contracts.

As noted by Corbett, the IHR allows the unelected director-general of the WHO to simply declare a PHEIC and, suddenly, all member states have to dance to his tune. It basically grants the WHO dictatorial powers over health policy.

PHEICs have included the phony H1N1 swine flu pandemic in 2009, the inconsequential Zika outbreak in 2016, the overhyped Ebola outbreak in 2019, and, of course, the massively exaggerated COVID pandemic in 2020. All of these PHEICs were poorly handled and the WHO was criticized as inept and corrupt15 in their wake.

So, to summarize, through the IHR, the WHO has already been significantly empowered to dictate global health policy with regard to pandemics, and they used that power to bamboozle the nations of the world into spending billions of dollars on countermeasures, especially drugs and vaccines, that didn’t work very well.

In that sense, the WHO is really just another wealth-transfer instrument. The WHO’s Big Pharma collaborators make billions on the taxpayers’ dime, while the people of the world are left to suffer the consequences of fast-tracked vaccines. Its handling of the COVID pandemic in particular has been unprecedentedly bad, as they were behind the withholding of early treatment with safe medicines worldwide.

As noted by ivermectin advocate Dr. Tess Lawrie,16 the WHO has also claimed the mRNA shots as safe as conventional vaccines, which is nowhere near the truth. Most all available data prove they are the most dangerous drugs ever created. Why would anyone expect the WHO to become less corrupt if given even more power and control?

**IHR Amendments May Also Restrict Rights and Freedoms**

Now, the IHR overrode and superseded the U.S. Constitution from the start, but in January 2022, the U.S. also submitted regulatory amendments17 that will give the WHO even more power to restrict your rights and freedoms.

May 22 through 28, 2022, the World Health Assembly will gather and vote on these amendments to the IHR and, if passed, they will be enacted into international law. These submitted amendments are in addition to the WHO pandemic treaty currently under discussion. As reported by Health Policy Watch, February 23, 2022:18

*“Washington wants to fast track a series of nitty-gritty, but far-reaching changes in the existing International Health Regulations that govern WHO and member state emergency alert and response — for consideration at this year’s World Health Assembly, 22-28 May.*

*The U.S. proposal19 for major IHR rule changes, obtained by Health Policy Watch, has been a topic of discussion in a series of closed-door meetings of WHO member states, which are considering ways to reform the existing IHR, as well as advancing a whole new WHO convention or other international instrument20 on pandemic prevention and response ...*

*The U.S. is expected to lead a parallel track of tightly-paced ‘informal’ member state negotiations to reach consensus on an IHR reform resolution for approval at this year’s 75th WHA \[World Health Assembly\] ...”*

The “new WHO convention or other international instrument” mentioned here refers to the WHO treaty currently under discussion. An intergovernmental negotiating body (INB) was established as a subdivision of the World Health Assembly in December 2021,21 for the purpose of drafting and negotiating this new pandemic treaty. And, as mentioned, this INB has begun that work.

However, as noted by Corbett, this is only the second time in the WHO’s history that an INB has been established. The first one was the INB of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control,22 22 years ago. So, this is not a well-established process, and it’s hard to predict how it will play out.

**Bill Gates Builds GERM Team for the WHO**

Another clue about what the WHO intends to do with more power comes from its primary funder, Bill Gates. Gates recently announced he’s building a pandemic response team for the WHO, which he would like to be called the ""Global Epidemic Response & Mobilization"" or GERM Team.

This team will be made up of thousands of disease experts under WHO’s purview, and will monitor nations and “decide when they need to suspend civil liberties, force populations to wear masks and close borders,” The Counter Signal reports.23

Of course, Gates is also the largest funder of the WHO (when you combine the donations from both his foundation and GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance). This and other relationships speak volumes about the corruption still ruling the WHO. At the end of the day, Gates is basically paying the WHO to dictate to the world what they must do to make Gates a ton of money. As noted by The Counter Signal:24

*“Gates’ announcement of the GERM team coincides with the World Health Organization’s drafting of a global pandemic treaty ... In the future, the pandemic treaty will not only ensure that member states abide by International Health Regulations but will also put the WHO in the driver’s seat, so to speak. Member states, including the US and Canada, will take their orders directly from the organization. As Conservative MP Leslyn Lewis explains:*

*‘The treaty includes 190 countries and would be legally binding. The treaty defines and classifies what is considered a pandemic, and this could consist of broad classifications, including an increase in cancers, heart conditions, strokes, etc. If a pandemic is declared, the WHO takes over the global health management of the pandemic.*

*Of even more concern, if this treaty is enshrined, the WHO would be in full control over what gets called a pandemic. They could dictate how our doctors can respond, which drugs can and can’t be used, or which vaccines are approved. We would end up with a one-size-fits-all approach for the entire world … A one-size-fits-all response to a health crisis doesn’t even work across Canada, let alone the entire globe’ ...*

*It isn’t unreasonable to assume that the GERM team, as a new branch of the WHO, would oversee making sure member states comply with the pandemic treaty after the draft is finalized and member states sign-on.*

*The next question, then, is how the WHO and Bill Gates would be able to monitor every individual in every country to determine whether enough people are sick to justify locking a region down.*

\*To this end, the WHO has contracted German-based Deutsche Telekom subsidiary T-Systems to develop a global vaccine passport system,\*25 *with plans to link every person on the planet to a QR code digital ID ... Thus, there will be one pandemic treaty, one GERM team, one global vaccine passport, and one World Health Organization to monitor every person on the planet.”*

**Under WHO Control, Vaccine Passports Are a Given**

Indeed, while countries around the world have scrubbed their COVID measures and backed away from vaccine passports, the WHO is still moving ahead with a global vaccine passport program.26

So, if the WHO is given the authority to dictate biosecurity rules for the world, you can bet they’ll insist on vaccine passports with built-in digital identity and readiness for a centralized programmable central bank digital currency (CBDC). As reported by the Western Standard:27

*“The WHO fully intends to provide support to its 194 member states to facilitate the implementation of the digital verification technology for countries’ national and regional verification of vaccine status.*

*‘COVID-19 affects everyone. Countries will therefore only emerge from the pandemic together. Vaccination certificates that are tamper-proof and digitally verifiable build trust. WHO is therefore supporting member states in building national and regional trust networks and verification technology.*

*The WHO’s gateway service also serves as a bridge between regional systems. It can also be used as part of future vaccination campaigns and home-based records,’ said Garrett Mehl, unit head of the WHO’s Department of Digital Health and Innovation, on Deutsche Telekom’s website.”*

**Can We Stop the International Pandemic Treaty?**

The question now is, can we stop this “international pandemic instrument” that the WHO is seeking? With short notice, the WHO announced it would accept public comment on the treaty for a total of five days.28 The World Council for Health (WCH) was among the few that acted quickly enough to submit a comment in opposition of the treaty. Lawrie delivered the WCH’s submission.29

The proposal to take control of pandemics at a central WHO level is untenable and threatens a global society ... It is foolhardy to even suggest that a ‘one size fits all’ response to a pandemic crisis across geographic zones characterized by hugely different parameters, could possibly be covered by a central bureaucratic process — the need for local decision making is of prime importance. \~ Robert Clancy, Ph.D.

In an April 26, 2022, update on Substack, Lawrie wrote:30

*“Despite the lack of notice, many grassroots organizations did what they could to spread the word and the World Council for Health’s #stopthetreaty campaign reached an astonishing 415 million people. Many of you made written submissions expressing your concerns. So many of you in fact, that I hear the WHO’s website crashed on the last day.”*

One person who missed the deadline was professor Robert Clancy, a leading clinical immunologist in Canada. He sent the comment he would have wanted to submit to Lawrie, who included it in her post:31

*“The proposal to take control of pandemics at a central WHO level is untenable and threatens a global society. I am in receipt of the World Council for Health response, and the superbly summarized view by Dr. Tess Lawrie. These concerns reflect the ‘across the board’ view of most Australian doctors ...*

*The failure to understand the restrictions of systemic vaccination for mucosal infection and the dangers of accumulated suppression that follows mindless booster programs, and failure to interrogate the massive databases regarding adverse events of genetic vaccines are but two of the serious mistakes perpetuated by the WHO ...*

*It is foolhardy to even suggest that a ‘one size fits all’ response to a pandemic crisis across geographic zones characterized by hugely different parameters, could possibly be covered by a central bureaucratic process — the need for local decision making is of prime importance.*

*The rule of science and the rule of the doctor-patient relationship must determine any response to a pandemic, and current experience where the rule of the narrative has so distorted disease outcomes — supported by the WHO — must make very clear the foolishness of rewarding incompetence and corruption with even greater powers.*

*I write this as the most experienced Clinical Immunologist in Australia, and a leading research scientist in Mucosal Immunology with a focus on ‘host-parasite relationship.’ Professor Robert Clancy AM FRS(N) MB BS BSc(Med) PhD DSc FRACP FRCP(A) FRCP(C)”*

**Make Your Voice Heard in June**

While many, like Clancy, didn’t get a chance to participate, the WHO has announced it will allow for two more days of public comment, June 16 and 17, 2022. As noted by Lawrie:32

*“Please also be aware of the proposed amendments to the International Health Regulations, to be voted on this May at the World Health Assembly.*

*Like the pandemic treaty, this is another move to seize greater powers and override the sovereign laws of individual nations. Some say this is more significant than the pandemic treaty: if voted in, it means the loss of our sovereignty from this November. James Roguski has written extensively about this on his Substack.33*

*There seems to be a concerted effort by the WHO and its controllers to attack our sovereignty from all angles. It is important we make it clear that we do not recognize the WHO as an authority over us and that we will not tolerate this abuse of power.*

*We are sovereign and will not be bound by the undertakings of corrupt officials who pretend to act on our behalf when signing away the inherent rights of the World's People. They do not act for us and we will not be bound.”*

I encourage you to make plans to have your voice heard June 16 and 17, 2022. Unfortunately, the WHO has not yet released any submission details. Your best bet right now is to sign up for the WCH’s newsletter. The last time, they issued links and instructions on how to submit your comment, and are sure to do the same for the June submission window. You can [**subscribe at the bottom of this page**](https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/news/2022/04/stopthetreaty-comment-who-pandemic-treaty/66422/), or on the [**WCH’s home page**](https://worldcouncilforhealth.org/).

To block the IHR amendments at the May 2022 World Health Assembly, we need to flood our respective delegations with opposition. A list of U.S. delegates can be found in Roguski’s Substack article, “[**Speaking Truth to Power**](https://jamesroguski.substack.com/p/speaking-truth-to-power?s=r).”

For contact information for other nations’ delegates, I would suggest contacting the regional office and ask for a list (see “Regions” in the blue section at the bottom of the [**World Health Assembly’s webpage**](https://www.who.int/about/governance/world-health-assembly)). It’s also possible that the WCH will publish guidance on it, so be sure to sign up for their newsletter.",8,11,1652651556.0
