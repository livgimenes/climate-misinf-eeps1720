What Happened to the Vikings in Greenland?,Manlygator,usually that viking settlement in greenland which was seemingly abandoned due to cooling weather is used for evidence that climate change can occur without greenhouse gasses and that warm weather is better than cold weather but this article claims that greenland was abandoned because the cooling weather caused a sea level rise yes contrary to everything the agw cult has said for 30 years they claim that cooling weather caused a sea level rise and they claim this is a warning about the present day sea level rise which is of course caused by humans because natural climate change magically stopped somewhere between 1850 and 1900 ce jesus christ httpswwwharvardmagazinecom202304greenlandvikingsflooded,1681829407,1,0,climateskeptics

Does anyone know if the IPCC is still using the hockey stick or has that been abandoned now?,kiwiheretic,i have been reading andrew montfords book on the hockey stick illusion and i think it makes some very good points the whole process of gauging global temperature over 200 years ago seems to be based on taking core samples from trees and then trying to relate that to temperature the one to come up with the hockey stick graph was michael mann and i have concerns about how he interacted with the scientific community withholding data and methodology to reproduce his findings etc and also nature journal which hardly seemed to show lack of political bias it also seems that mcintyre has largely debunked manns graph saying he used flawed statistical analysis which it goes into quite a lot of detail in montfords book does anyone know what the current status of the hockey stick is in scientific circles or even politically,1681164305,1,0,climateskeptics

Attribution of the Present-Day total greenhouse effect,FancyEveryDay,this paperhttpsagupubsonlinelibrarywileycomdoifull1010292010jd014287 determines the relative absorption effect of the different components of the atmosphere and models the net effects of removing or increasing the level of a given component  summary this paper isnt meant to be extremely precise but rather to describe the approximate effects and interactions of various atmospheric gasses on the global energy budget in response to the repetition of outdated or incorrect statistics this paper uses an estimation that the atmosphere absorbs a net value of approximately 155 wm2 of long wave radiation from the ground which becomes subject to adiabatic process of atmospheric gasses lapse rate rather than radiating directly into space because of these processes the upper atmosphere radiates energy absorbed at a much lower rate than it is from the surface this results in the temperature of the atmosphere rising until the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere reach a temperature sufficient to emit this 155 wm2 into space along with the amounts transferred by convection and evaporation which are also subject to to the lapse rate the greenhouse effect is defined here as the 33c degrees measured increase of the earths nearsurface atmosphere over the expected black body temperature individual direct effects of atmospheric gasses accounting for overlapping absorption  co2 accounts for about 20 of the ghe  water vapor 50  clouds 25  all remaining contributors total 5 water vapor and clouds arent considered greenhouse gasses in the usual sense despite their dominant effect because they are themselves extremely reactive to the effects of other forcings for example doubling co2 ppm increases radiation absorption by 4w and and temperature by 7c but results in overall 20w and 27c increases after increased evaporation of water and cloud cover and are factored in removing all non water based greenhouse gasses results in a 35 degree drop in avg temperature from 15c to 20c after feedback is factored in,1680982505,1,0,climateskeptics

Nuclear power,Hazel1928,so i am brand new here in this sub trying to get a feel what is your response to this tentative statement the earth does seem to be going through a warming phase humans probably have amplified that just a little bit americans and all good guys should be moving toward nuclear but that takes time so the first goal is to be energy independent energy exporters and finish the keystone pipeline the first goal could be met within 25 years if policymakers cooperate we extract energy in a more environmentally friendly manner plus that wsy america gets the profits instead of saudi arabia and venezuela dont forget the saudis recently stabbed us in the back by pretending they wanted to normalize relations with israel and then suddenly they normalized with iran in a deal brokered by china second goal is to transition our electricity generation to nuclear fission because the whole process of energy generation over the life time of a plant up to 7080 years is cheaper safer and produces less air pollution than fossil fuels we will still use fossil fuel for transportation for the foreseeable future this is a goal that could be achieved in 20 years with the right conditions in dc but conditions in dc will vary so say 40 years to achieve that goal my third and final goal is to convert electricity generation to fusion thats a 100 year goal im putting this out there to see how much i am in sync with this sub,1679514619,1,0,climateskeptics

Troposphere does not cool through radiation,starfield_pro,if near surface air masses cooled through radiation then the energy balance for the earth would be far too unstable how would you design a system that didnt overheat or overcool based on radiation balance instead the structure of atmospheric cells and the angular momentum of air within them creates a stable equilibrium as surface air is irradiated by solar energy that energy goes into work against friction and entropy to keep the cell in motion the heat is then transferred by advection to the tropopause air doesnt conduct meaningfully but figurately air masses do thermopressure gradients and lateral kinetic transfers of energy among air particles maintain common temperatures within the air mass however after advection the upper limit of the air mass is exposed to substantially lower pressures on top while on bottom the air masses below serve as a floor some air will therefore continue to travel with the cell but other air molecules will escape the pressure gradients equilibrium also sufficiently cool air particles will come into the pressure gradient and join it more heat on the surface will lead to more work against gravity which will allow for more exchange of energy with the upper atmosphere kinetically the heat sink is too large its also apparent that a lot of energy is transferred to other cells and transported to extreme latitudes whatever balance of energy goes up or ns is a matter of observation and good modeling but in principle solar radiation will transport advectively and kinetically obviously the oceans are involved and it can become quite complicated once that energy is in the upper atmosphere there is less ability to do work and so over time it will radiate back into space greenhouse effect hypothesis is absurd for 2 reasons 1 radiation doesnt work in a way where colder entities transfer energy to warmer entities if the premise is exceptionally hot particles above exceptional for this or that reason warming nevertheless still quite cold and high particles below the problem is this structure is a bit dubious but more importantly its unclear how it would ultimately have any meaningful bearing on surface temperatures as this is outside of the advection process 2 circling back if radiation balance did play a factor in warming then the earth couldnt possibly maintain equilibrium over the long run as for oceans this appears to have to do with the geological configuration of continents and depth of seas combine with solar irradiance levels this formula drives the energy balance of the atmospheric cells whether there is ice or not at high latitudes etc i just dont see where greenhouse gas fits in it doesnt really seem like h2o can properly be thought of as a genuine greenhouse gas its more of a highly efficient energy retention and transfer system h2o is moreso preventing a cascade of cooling than contributing to warming,1679416273,1,0,climateskeptics

mika showed in his paper of the arctic seas increasing in temperature because using logic would that not defy the second law of thermodynamics  also can you see why this 2022 statement from nsidc seems to be a little misleading  the september 2022 average arctic sea ice extent was 487 million square kilometers 188 million square miles tying with 2010 for eleventh lowest in the satellite record figure 1a extent was 154 million square kilometers 595000 square miles below the 1981 to 2010 average and 130 million square kilometers 502000 square miles above the record minimum set in 2012 the annual minimum extent was reached on september 18 and the autumn freezeup is now well underway httpsnsidcorgarcticseaicenews202210httpsnsidcorgarcticseaicenews202210 because according to your reliable sources own website and data linked above 2010 was at 490 million square kilometers and 2017 was in fact the one year tying with 2022  487 million square kilometers and using nsidc data the record minimum set in 2012 of 518 million square kilometers was not the lowest for that decade 2020 was with 392 million square kilometers and all but 2013 were much lower in most cases than 2022 except the preceding and following year with 518 million square kilometers and 502 million square kilometers respectively and if 2022 was 13 million square kilometers above the 2012 figure of 518 million square

Climate Change for Dummies,StedeBonnet1,all of us are ignorant about most things the universe is boundless while our brains and our time on earth are extremely limited that is why socrates famously was quoted as asserting that he was wise as he knew that he knew nothing most men assume they are wise because they know things while true wisdom is recognizing the limits of ones understanding of course as beings who must live in the world and make decisions we are required to make considered judgments about the way things are so the wisdom of the active person is to act based upon evidence and beliefs based on that evidence and then adapt to circumstances thats a long way of saying that it drives me bananas when i have a conversation with people who are absolutely certain they know things about which they could not possibly be certain worse it is infuriating to get lectured by people who have no idea at all about the subject they are passionately lecturing about which brings us to among other things the climate change absolutists as a scientist i am perfectly willing to examine the evidence listen to theories explore what is known what is deduced what is supposed and what we are only guessing at and consider competing arguments yes i am a medical doctor but i also hold a bachelor of science in biochemistry molecular biology and genetics im a scientist i like data despite that although by no means am i what the fanatics would call a denier i am reflexively given that pejorative by people like adolescent swedish demagogues and us congressmen with associates degrees in communications with a minor in african art history rather i am a skeptic of what i have been told of the data the volume and longevity of which are confounders of the reliability of the models which exclude certain variables like the sun which are heavy influencers of climate and also of the scale of whatever problems may arise from anthropomorphic activity but i dont scoff because as a scientist i think the data is inadequate i know that i dont know enough to be certain of anything i keep following the science as the phrase has been coined but unlike the people who so commonly bandy about that phrase i actually do follow science which i understand its power and its limitation eventually our available science will get good enough to make decent predictions i hope we arent there yet however one of the reasons i am quite frustrated by all the furor over climate is because of how droolingly ignorant almost everybody panicking about the the changes in earths climate at geological timescales are we keep hearing about temperature trends over decades and occasionally centuries but almost nobody talks about the actual timescale at which climate change takes place we only have reliable climate data such as it is for the last few thousand years of which there is only detailed data for the last hundred or so and even that is extrapolated from a limited number of strategically placed monitoring devices worldwide or nonscientifically recorded anecdotal analog data by scientists before there were such things as computers or fields of data analysis everybody is freaking out about a degree or two in temperature and very small increases in sea level its a joke and there is a term for this in the realm of statistics statistically insignificant sorry it is we have no idea what the significance is of changes in 10000 year old ice core samples from antarctica in a planet 46 billion years old is this aberrant part of a normal cycle related to solar activity we have no idea and scientists who claim they do are simply lying to you presumably for either ego or political demagoguery purposes only a few thousand years ago the sea level was about 400 feet lower than today much of north america was buried under a mile or more of ice and human beings were crossing land bridges to settle new continents we were at a glacial maximum not that many generations ago according to existing data as things warmed up things changed dramatically and generally for the better if you arewellalive it turns out that most living things dont like things like being buried under glaciers who knew we are not talking about millions of years ago this isnt plate tectonics human beings watched the floods that opened up the english channel and the connection of the mediterranean to the atlantic ocean human beings walked to north america on a land bridge from asia the map of the earth we see today has been vastly different within the lifespan of the human race human eyes in north america saw glaciers that were miles high and temperatures that were wildly colder than today so dont whine about human extinction from a small increase in sea levels melting ice or a degree and a half of temperature increase stop the insanity and histrionics please it is palpably absurd all this is to say that its increasingly annoying to have a conversation with somebody about earths climate when they havent got a clue about the earths climate history it would be like a religion if they believed in religion its peculiar that the same people always seem to come down on the same side of both of those issues now the theory that increases in co2 in the atmosphere would lead to increased global temperatures is based on physics and hence is hardly implausible i dont dispute the physics although no model in todays computers is sophisticated enough to actually make any predictions the climate is ridiculously complex and we simply dont understand or even measure all the important variables but i am willing to listen eager to listen interested in the theories but those theories are as well developed as our theories of what happens when two black holes collidewe have nice very simple stories that get some of the broad strokes but hardly a comprehensive understanding this is why we keep hearing about new discoveries and theories and invest billions in new space telescopes but also why we should tread carefully in basing massive generational policies the impact of which we have only begin to appreciate on such limited understanding the belief that modest increases in atmospheric temperatures will lead to a global disaster and mass extinction is based upon voodoo and nothing more we are currently in what is likely to be a short interglacial period we are technically still in an ice age and the current global temperature is still lower than it was in the last interglacial period this is not new science global temperatures today in other words are below average compared to most of the time life has existed on earth the earth is not burning but still shivering unless there was a great mass extinction 140000 years agoand there wasntthe likelihood that reaching the same global temperatures as happened then or 340000 years ago seems like not much to worry about last i checked human beings walked the earth 140000 years ago and our hominid ancestors did 340000 years ago these are long time periods by human standards but they are a blink of an eye in geologic terms or in the history of life on earth the available data simply does not go far enough back to make reliable models or predictions certainly not with the confidence interval upon which to base massive and devastating economic and societal upheaval by enacting shortsighted and overweening governmental public policies so how am i supposed to listen to and take seriously anybody who breaks down in tears fearing a degree or two in temperature increase how seriously should i take policymakers that predict the end of life on earth in eight years when even the most diehard cynical apocalyptic climate model makes no such prediction not even close in the next hundred years these people frankly clearly have no idea of what they speak climate fanatics are insufferable mostly because they talk so much and know so little i once in the not too recent past had a conversation with a very smart colleague who was leaving medicine to run a nonprofit that pushed for renewable energy he lectured me for almost an hour about the melting of the arctic and how it would raise sea levels after listening politely i pointed at the glass of water in which the ice had melted the level at which it was filled hadnt changed because no water was added to the glass as the ice melted try it floating ice has the same mass as meltwater and adds nothing to sea levels as it melts the melting of the arctic sea ice is literally irrelevant to sea levels obviously if a glacier melts and flows from the land to the ocean that adds to the total volume but this man lecturing mewho actually advised the legislature on energy policy and climate changehad no idea that the arctic ice is floating and frozen or liquid would add nothing to sea levels yknowbecause physics needless to say our conversation ended there neither of us had changed the others mind of course but at least i temporarily humiliated him and perhaps prompted him to think critically so it was a good day we are lectured to worry about climate change and devastating losses in biodiversity so i invite people to visit my state of ohio which was buried under a glacier not so long ago and then visit the equatorial rain forests then come back to me and explain how i should be concerned that ohios biodiversity would decrease because of increased temperatures ill wait becausewait for itmost biodiversity occurs where it is warmer which is easy to explaineverything about life is about energy from the mitochondria and cell to complex ecosystems energy not spent on keeping yourself warm is energy you have to spend elsewhere pursuing food bolstering your immune system to fight disease learning new skills reproducing i freely admit that i am ignorant of what changes the environment will see with a degree or two of increased temperature and also admit the possibility that human activity might contribute to such an increase and i will do so right after climate fanatics admit that reduced fossil fuel use would lead to the starvation and death of billions of human beings right here right now in addition to completely abstaining from fossil fuels or any product of them because without fossil fuels human beings would not only be infinitely poorer but most of us would be dead frozen starving or dead of disease or of any number of other horrors in short anybody who ignorantly but confidently yells the science while knowing almost nothing about the actual science studies or models is not only insufferable but childish an ohioan living in a spot that was recently buried under a mile of ice worrying about global warming is a dunce i invite him or her to spend a year without gas or electricity that would last a day or two in our climate there is a reason why the upper midwest was still being settled after most of the continent was filling up look at the population of canada please its a huge country yet everybody is clustered at the us border and everybody is comparatively almost nobody because it is too cold to live there the population of the northwest territories in canadaa huge chunk of land 45000 people you could dump much of europe in it and nobody lives there because it is too cold i am not opposed to being good stewards of the environment or seeking out renewable sources of energy but neither am i interested in turning civilization on its head to do so based on the thinnest veneer of socalled science all the while denying that there are potentially hidden or not so hidden unintended consequences of doing so take electric cars you know what there is several hundred pounds of in electric cars nickel ever been to a nickle mine where they mine nickel sulfate theres nickel ore everywhere know what that becomes when it rains nickel sulfite plus yesyou guessed itsulfuric acid go to a nickel mine it looks like the surface of the moon but yeah sure glad my prius is saving the planet if the climate movement wishes to be taken seriously then perhaps they should stop conducting themselves in a manner that is manifestly unserious if you turn an

"Maybe Albedo, not C02, causes Climate Change",dacj1s,in another debate i was told that the only thing that makes it possible for less thermal radiation to reach space than what leaves the surface is the presence of materials in the atmosphere which can absorb thermal radiation he of course was referring to greenhouse gases respectfully i disagree i have many concerns or maybe i should call them questions for which i have not accepted the answers to date from climatologists i understand what some climatologists are saying i just find their explanations simplistic and naive despite their efforts to justify their argument with energy balance equations they systematically ignore the fact that the ideal gas law along with gravity means that the temperature at the surface of a planetary body with an atmosphere will always be higher than the calculated black body temperature for that same planetary body without an atmosphere regardless of the atmospheres components firstly albedo is assumed to be a number that is treated as a constant around 03 what if albedo has decreased due to for example pollution since some reference year then more radiation would be absorbed at the earths surface the northern hemisphere would be most affected as it has the most sources of pollution weve only been able to measure albedo since the 1950s with the advent of satellites in that case we are not wrong to go after dirty fuels but wrong to accuse co2 with regard to albedo i have yet another concern albedo is typically measured using optical frequencies but most of the energy from the sun is in the ultraviolet what is earths albedo in the ultraviolet albedo is a more complicated phenomenon than presented by climatologists it also varies by angle of incidence of incoming radiation a second concern i have is the use of spectrum graphs that seem to show how the earth is absorbing more energy than it receives the assumption is that since the earths average surface temperature is 288k the earths blackbody temperature must be 288k but we know the atmosphere by itself radiates and due to gravity and adiabatic compression the temperature of the troposphere decreases with height so what is the average temperature of a column of atmosphere it goes from an average of 288k at the surface through 255k blackbody temperature of the earth without an atmosphere to something like 273k at top of troposphere depending where you measure what if the effective blackbody temperature of the earth as measured from space was actually less than 288k then the spectrum graphs might actually show an energy balance as expected thirdly i cannot accept the premise that co2 a trace gas at 004 of the atmosphere can force a significant change in temperature it just makes no sense there is simply not enough energy that could be absorbed by co2 and then passed on to affect changes to temperature oh then fourthly the idea that there is such a thing as radiative forcing is ridiculous if such a thing was possible it would mean we have the means to raise temperatures above a heat source temperature simply by raising co2 levels i have other concerns with climatologists modeling that presume co2 as the culprit the above are some of my top concerns so what about global warming i am more inclined to believe it might be changes in albedo than changes in co2 levels,1677713297,1,0,climateskeptics

Questions for faithful of radiative greenhouse theory:,AdminsRsubhuman,the atmosphere is loosely bound by gravity yet some of the atmosphere is lost to space all the time parcels of the atmosphere heated by the sun immediately expand and rise due to lower density this convection transports heat from surface closer to space speeding the radiative loss to space this convection is capable of increasing if solar input increases there is no evidence of a cooler gas at higher elevation having the energy capacity to warm parcels below it as the parcels below it already possess the higher energy state that the cooler gas would be trying to impart to it similar to how a molecule with an electron already in the excited state cannot absorb another photon that would put it in the excited state a molecule vibrating or speeding at a certain rate cannot be made to vibrate faster nor speed faster by the same energy photon that got it there in the first place so how do you believe the warmer lower layers absorb energy they cant absorb by their nature of already possessing that energy level why do you only reference experiments in which co2 is heated by a hotter source and what is the mechanism for slowing cooling when the convection overwhelms the radiation in the lower troposphere as warmed parcels expand upward as heat transfer is strictly a function of the temperature difference slowing cooling could only theoretically raise the minimum temperature but could not increase max temperature as max temperature is set by the heating source the sun also show your model that uses the true solar earth system using true solar input rather than a non physical average that stupidly assumes the earth is flat and always facing the sun at twice the real distance from the sun which is what a 240 wm2 constant insolation assumption is the true solar power is measured at over 1000wm2 in the tropics on a clear day this energy is almost completely absorbed by the oceans and redistributed by convection also show the exact amount of solar energy you believe is trapped by the exact amount of human produced co2 that is still in the atmosphere and show your calculations and why you are so sure you know the temperature changes by some exact amount and have ruled out all natural sources of co2 and have proven that co2 actually traps heat i anticipate a lot of hand waving and preaching the gospel of climate religion but no substance to back it up,1677690890,1,0,climateskeptics

If the effects of climate change are mostly felt by the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in winter does that mean the only thing to be at all concerned about are rising sea levels?,alexduckkeeper_70,elevated co2 levels and temperature changes have both been occurring mostly in the northern hemisphere and the impacts have been mostly felt in winter the tropics have been much less affected this is important because it means that a the impact of rising co2 levels will be negligible on tropical storms  as these are generated at sea the negligible rise in sea temperatures can not be affecting these b the idea that some parts of hotter regions of the planet will become uninhabitable and that there are climate refugees due to these increased temperatures is reduced c all other models which forecast increase extreme events in the tropics need to be looked at with a degree of scepticism for example the average night temperature in winter canada is about 15 celsius if this has risen from 18 celsius is this a massive issue,1677355719,1,0,climateskeptics

Problems with CERES satellite data,AdminsRsubhuman,httpswwwmdpicom2072429212122040 ceres toa flux data set is produced by using the radiances measured by the ceres instruments which are then converted to fluxes by using the scenetype dependent adms these adms are functions of cloud properties that are retrieved from imagers that are flying alongside the ceres instruments in this paper we illustrated that a spurious discontinuity in imager calibration introduced an erroneous trend in cloud optical depth retrieval and thus affected the toa sw flux trend when the ed4 cloud optical depth was decreased by 0005 per month to mimic the ed2 cloud optical depth trend the resulting toa sw flux trend changed from 035  018 wm2 per decade to 061  018 wm2 per decade with all other inputs and algorithms being identical regionally the flux can differ by up to 10 wm2 with large differences around itcz and near 60 n and 60 s lw flux differences due to different vza ranges are smaller comparing with the sw flux difference with daytime and nighttime monthly mean lw flux difference less than 03 wm2 regionally the lw flux differences up to 4 wm2 are seen over the tropical oceans near the itcz and over the western pacific ocean these flux differences caused by using different vza ranges can result in a discontinuity in ceres toa flux remember alarmists say that doubling co2 will have about a 3 wm2 heat trapping effect,1676571218,1,0,climateskeptics
Heat is not a conserved quantity. Heat is energy that flows from hot to cold.,AdminsRsubhuman,httpsphiloidcomquestion122635isheataconservedquantity there are different areas at earths surface and at some height above it so saying wm2 at the surface and some height above it are equal violates conservation of energy because the m2 are different also energy is not just temperature and no part of the earth is ever at equilibrium this does change the outgoing flux as flux is dependent on temperature there is only 240wm2 emitted at a small part of the atmosphere at any given time total energy is conserved but heat is not a conserved quantity the ipcc is attempting to conserve heat but that is contrary to thermodynamics energy is converted into melting ice ocean currents winds convection of all types such an energy balance is not reflected in the ipcc 240wm2 that they are trying to balance that is an attempt to balance heat which is not a conserved quantity heat tends toward zero as the system tends toward but never gets close to equilibrium heat flows from hot to cold during a sunny hot day why would you stand underneath a small umbrella that only blocks the sun but does not block the remainder of the supposed atmospheric radiation the ipcc says the atmosphere radiates 333w to you for every 161w the sun radiates to you see the k amp trenberth energy balance which is not an energy balance at all why would you stand under the umbrella when the atmosphere all around it radiates you even more but you have done this because you feel the heat of the sun is much greater than any from the atmosphere in fact thermodynamics says that the cooler atmosphere cannot heat you as heat flows from hot to cold httpstheoryuwinnipegcamodtechnode79html,1676567477,1,0,climateskeptics

CO2 does not heat up faster than air because of absorbing IR.,AdminsRsubhuman,co2 has a lower thermal conductivity than ordinary air  air is almost twice as conductive as co2 and air is an excellent thermal insulator  witness double glazing the people who perform all sorts of experiments using lamps to heat thermometers in bottles with different gases inside are simply proving this every time but they think it is backradiation  and of course these have zero to do with any greenhouse effect they seem to not understand that a thermometer directly irradiated by a hot source comes into an equilibrium with the heating power of the incident radiation minus the thermal conductivity of the surrounding atmosphere  whether ordinary air or co2,1676519514,1,0,climateskeptics
Work = Force * distance,AdminsRsubhuman,1 yes it is true the sun heats the earth to only 18 degrees if there was no atmosphere and no gravity eliminate gravity so the air floats away and we freeze 2 but there is an atmosphere which is there because gravity pulls it against the earth the same calculation in 1 to get 18 will give you 59 degrees where the sun light touches the atmosphere as opposed to the ground below the atmosphere happily this is indeed the temp at top of troposphere so we know it is true 3 now as you drop through the troposphere down to sea level there is work getting done under the force of gravity use wf x d this is roughly 98 mss x 11 km  108 degrees so the earth surface is now 59108  49 degrees which far hotter than it really is by about 34 degrees 4 fortunately in the atmosphere there is the greenhouse gas h2o it adsorbs a lot of workenergy by turning water into gas and back into water this has been measured for hundreds of years and the effect is the temperature gradient under gravity of 98 degrees per km in perfectly dry air reduces to 65 degrees in moist air thus the greenhouse moisture has a cooling effect of 33 degrees per km 5 thus the greenouse cools the earth from 49 degrees as calculated in 3 to the real temperature of 15 degrees greenhouse gas aka h2o is a coolant to deny the above you have to deny gravity this is what i ask alarmist do you agree gravity exists do you agree gravity is a force and applying force produces energy work in all the above i have not had to mention co2 or ghe but i have accurately explained the earths temperature as opposed to alarmists who are left with an inexplicable 33 degree hole for which they have to invent something to fill the only inexplicable thing is why gravity is ignored once you put it in the thinking the flat earth model does not have to challenged as scary as that is you can also ask people why moist rainforests at the same latitude as arid deserts that have more co2 rotting vegetation of the forest are actually cooler than deserts it is because ghg aka moisture is a coolant and why is venus so hot it has nothing to do with co2 but is because gravity is high and the atmosphere is deep ie w  f x d is a big number,1676519116,1,0,climateskeptics
